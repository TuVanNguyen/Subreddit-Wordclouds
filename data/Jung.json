I hope it can be of use for anyone as an example of active imagination.\n----\nWho are you?\nI do not know who I am.\nYes, you do. What you want?\nI do not know.\nYes, you do.\nI think I want THAT everything I could never have the way I want.\nBut you already have it. Why so much internal crying and anxiety? Why are you doing this to me our whole life? Because?\nI do not know. Why never go till the end, what hold you back so much?\nI always thought this was you.\nIt's us, we're a team.\nSo what do you want, how can I help you?\nOnly you know the answer.\nOk I got it. But for gods sake, your crying and suffering does not help me with this task at all. So could you please just relax and trust me? Only with your help will I get definitive answers.\nI just can't wait any longer.\nWait for what?\nFor woman I love, children, a happy life, fulfilment and all of these things.\nWe discovered together that it doesn't bring us happiness, right? Only when we are in pure harmony can we have a wife and children, all those things.\nI agree. But what about the sex and affection we need so badly? This is a natural need.\nWe will work on this together. And for that I need your help. You have to stop making me feel down and down. I know that childhood was difficult but we need to overcome it. What do you think causes this?\nI think it was some successions of minor traumas. The neighbors child who pulled my hair. Lack of reaction on my first year of school, remember L.? Then came the loss of my father. And that whole thing that we all know happened.\nYou have to forgive and forget these people. This is our responsibility now. They have as many problems and insecurities as we do and they don't represent what people think about us.\nOk but how can I do this?\nJust trust me, us, all of us here. Relax and do what you always knew how to do, even if you don't remember it anymore. I saw the shit you went through. But know that it doesn't exist. It will be OK.\nOk but you have to talk and be more open with the girls.\nWe have. We shut our feelings because of your illness. Help me heal you.\nHow are you going to do that?\nWe will. We will discover love in everything, not just in people and objects and girls. You know that when that happens, things will be different.\nBut weren't we supposed to only think on the present?\nThat! You are learning. Something still afflicts you. What is that?\nThe aggression.\nCan you remember what it is?\nThat time I was about 5 and ran away from home and got beaten up by my father. Perhaps this time and other times. Fear of aggression, fear of rejection. That ear tug here and there.\nI believe you never made it out of that punishment. You are still that child crying, grounded in that dark room after taking the belting and never managed to get out of this situation. The good news is that you can now. Maybe you never noticed it because I never talked to you. Forgive me.\nI forgive you. I never thought I was to blame, I never said anything either.\nTell me when you're ready to leave this dark room\n--------\nThe second after the last sentence I started to cry. I cried uncontrollably for about 40 minutes. It was the first time I can recall being able to cry on that intensity after several years. \nAs I cried I could see a lot of things, including my father, crying for what he's done to me. Me forgiving him for beating me, me forgiving him for dying when I was 9. I imagined myself going out of my room and slowing getting out of the house, seeing the world, the green grasses, the birds.\nI had no idea that belting affected me that much, to me it was just a small deal.\nBut that aggression took my divine child away and locked into a room. I am still stuck, because that child goes back to the room when it's not feeling secure and safe yet. But now I know this Jungian thing works.\n\n"}, {"title": "Endless pondering and failure to live in the present - anima possession?

When I've seeing her behaviour paterns, I started to relate to her, to only at the end to have huge crush on this character, the end result is, I started to fully identify as that character, as if the character is me. To note out, I am male in real life, saying this just to mention it for those who will think I am female, I'm not.\nWith this in mind, I felt a huge mental release. I somehow started to think very clearly and intuitively, as if I fully mastered my intuition, it just felt so supernatural, like out of this world. But at the same time, I felt huge anxiety and completely loosen my appetite, as if I dont feel hunger no more, even though I didnt eat anything to warrant that. When I went to sleep it became so difficult to fall asleep because of the insane anxiety I was experiencing for no reason, but as I was dozing off later, I started seeing dream imagery.\nWith this imagery, I've seen a kid lying inside a wooden tree (spaced out), as he is getting up and facing the sun with full embrase, as the sun is rising up. There was a wall at the side, there we're the words \"Id, Ego, Superego\", where underneath the word ego, there was an arrow pointing down, as if the ego has fallen.\nBefore those this event of identification with an Anime Girl character, I was experiencing some sort of sorrow, or worry as if I had rejected myself, that my visions and ideals to follow are unrealistic and judged by others as bad. With this, I had other dream imagery (Well 4):\nIt was space, I was in a random place in a galaxy densily populated by stars. The imagery shown me 2 objects standing near each other in the opposite of my view; A black hole and a White hole. The blackhole was obviously black, bending light around and twitching in a creepy way, to the opposite there was a White hole, flashing out white light.\nPhysical Representation:  https://i.imgur.com/XhmpMGy.png \nThe second dream imagery, had an image of Ariel the little mermaid. The image was set at night, with almost full moon fully shining down into the sea, Ariel was however not in the sea, she was at some pool instead, she is looking at the moon, with sad expression\nPhysical Representation (I apologize for my shit drawing skills):  https://i.imgur.com/OrZLvN4.png \nThe third dream imagery, was set in some random street in the city I live in the setting was full night, with street lights turned on. On the otherside of the street, we're stairs. From the stairs was coming down an Anime Girl, as she is moving in closer, she started flashing pure white light at me (Similar to the Light from the White hole in the first Dream imagery). The Anime girl looked 100% exactly like this:  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1l2Utt2gEpQ/maxresdefault.jpg (In the left side, the female character. Ignore the Skeleton in the right side, It's unrelated).\nNow 4th Dream imagery, it looked like some abandoned building, there are stairs leading to some fully pitch dark basement, from the dark Red, monster like eyes appeared, the following phrase was heard \"She is a victim.\", actualy it was my own thought as I was dozing off to sleep.\nPhysical representation:  https://i.imgur.com/KIZcd4B.png\n\n"}, {"title": "I read in psychology today that a fetish is the opposite of a phobia, both are defense mechanisms but one does it through fear other through pleasure.

(self.Jung)", "likes": "1", "comments": "2", "content": "This may be a long post but I think it's all relevant to the story. \n I'm 28 year old male in a happy May - December relationship. She has completely changed my world perspective and has helped my soul evolve. However my S/O is not the topic I just gave you that for co text. \n\nWhen I was in middle school I developed a strong attraction to a girl name Mary (Fake Name). I really liked her and I (know) she liked me. We flirted in class all the time but it was the 8th grade and honestly, all I thought about was having sex with every girl I saw. I think relationships are hard to build upon when that's going on. \n\nThe next next four years Mary and I had limited contact we each other. It wasn't until our senior year of high school that we had another class. My feelings for her never faded and (I don't think) her feelings for me faded either. She was still beautiful and the same person overall but I was...husky/fat and extremely introverted at this time. And to be honest I was beyond high school and it's superficial social system. Anyways, that year came and went. Mary and I became good class friends again but after graduation she moved away and was physically out of my life like 99.9% of the rest of my class. \n\n  For the next eight years I would hear every so often about where Mary was and what she was doing. I would be glad to hear about her and hoped she was doing well. However, during these same eight years Mary would manifest in my dreams on a semi-reoccuring basis. The feelings that accompanied these dreams were joy, love, and a yearning to see her but I never came close to contacting her in any way. Our lives had taken different paths and I doubt she felt the same. \n\n Flash forward to (May 2019), two of my friends Tom and Mark were coming up for a weekend. I hadn't seen them in a while, especially Mark who I hadn't contacted in over a year. Tom tells me the week before they're coming up that it won't be just them two but Mark is coming up with wait for it...Mary. Apparently they had been in a relationship for over a year. \n\n When I read the text I must admit I was completely stunned and even afraid. But I processed the new information and an hour later I came to feel excited to see Mary again. FYI, I felt no betrayal towards Mark because neither he nor Tom nor anyone else except my S/O really knew I liked Mary all those years ago. I keep a lot of things to myself and only one-two people knows about the Mary dreams. The whole first night I was anxious.\n    \"What is she like now? Is she happy? I want to\n     Tell her about the dreams. Wait no, don't do that\n     Stupid\". \n\n  By the day of our get together I had overcome my anxiety. I have lost a lot of weight since high school and I can say objectively that I'm fairly handsome. Also my confidence and overall state of being has evolved WAY beyond the high school part of me so I'm pretty good with myself and I was at ease with whole situation. I did have some nerves but overall I was thankful for the opportunity to see Mary again. \n\n   We all met at a restaurant. She looked relativilly the same. Of course 9 years older but still beautiful. (This next part is especially essential to the story). When we started talking I couldn't get over how she sounded. Her voice seemed...different. at least different than I remembered. It was her speech pattern. The way she spoke certain words with added emotions seemed inauthentic to me. I found it slightly annoying. And ten minutes into the conversation I could tell she cared more about how she was perceived much more than I do. This dinner interaction was a big eye-opener for me. After the dinner we all walked around before the movie started. Mary and I continued to talk while Mark and Tom talked. This was fun too but I could see just how far beyond her I had gone. Then we all met again the next day for a hike and a walk downtown. Again, Mary and I talked more about our lives and again it was really nice but I continued to feel more evolved than her. Overall, I ascertained that Mary is insecure and that she cares about matters I think are more trivial. That said she is also a very nice person with an open mind and an empathetic heart . As I watched them drive away I was still left feeling physically attracted to Mary and I wanted nothing but the best for her and Mark, but I just felt too far beyond her psychologically, emotionally, and spirititually.\n\nFor the next month after that weekend, I thought little about Mary and I don't think she came to me in any dreams. Nonetheless, on some random night she appeared in my dream reawakening those same feelings from before. She continued to pop up more often until I would say three months ago that she started manifesting in my dreams at the same rate as before that weekend. (FINALLY IM GETTING TO MY QUESTIONs). \n\nI believe in soul evolution. I''m a mature/old soul and I know that I'm further along than Mary and that if we were in a relationship I know I would struggle with her less experienced soul, but can anyone tell me why I dream about her so often? Why do those profound and deep joyful, loving emotions swell within my when I see her after waking from a dream?   Do I really love her even after that weekend? Or does she represent some inner aspect within me? \nI really don't know but I would love to hear interpretations and suggestions. If you've made it this far, thank you :)\n\n"}, {"title": " What is the Anima?

I was looking out of the window, and a firetruck was parked against the curb directly in front of my house. Nothing seemed abnormal in the dream, and I didn't feel especially positive or negative towards the firetruck. I woke up and sort of forgot about the dream, until later in the day when I was in my room around noon.

The firetruck drove past my house, went around the col-de-sac, and drove back past my house the other way without slowing down or stopping.

(self.Jung)", "likes": "7", "comments": "8", "content": "Through shadow work I am noticing that I love being how I am. I've found the pleasure in these states of pain, anxiety, sadness, no responsibility, not caring about things etc.\nIt just sort of becomes funny. I sat down to meditate with things in my past that used to bring me great pain. There is still pain there for sure but I just laughed during the meditation. They just feel like things that happened but something is telling me they are not fully resolved.\nThis funny-ness is sort of unsettling. I have seemed to land in a place where all of the things I was working on to 'fix' now feel apart of me. I embody these things. I do not even feel so much that I need to change. If there is bliss and pleasure in every aspect of life then why would I change?\nThe idea of changing for me brings about a greater sense of charity and selflessness - being of service and helping others however I feel an annoyance with this, that I don't really want to help people so much as feel good about giving advice.\nThis sort of troubles me but then I realise I enjoy this feeling. I enjoy putting out an image of myself that doesn't ring completely true with how I am feeling. I feel quite split. I want to help people but also they somewhat annoy me.\nIt's a funny place to be but I feel as though I identify with the jester archetype.\n\u200b\n\nThe Jester uses humour to heal, reveal and hide even the deepest of human traumas.\nThey are not concerned with romance or quests, but instead, with making everything seem lighter, so that reality is not such a heavy load to bear. \n\nOther functions of the Jester:\n\nTo highlight the paradoxes and absurdity of life\nTo use humour to show where hypocrisy has taken hold\nTo close the gap between the powerful and the powerless\nTo smooth out aggression and arguments\nTo banish anxiety and depression\nTo banish fear\n\nThe Jester is present in the now, rather than dwelling on the past or future. It is not goal-oriented, which can be a welcome relief from stress.\nShadow side:\n\nNot healthy - they use humour to avoid looking at the shadow or deepest aspects of life.\nCan belittle others, laugh at their sincerely-held beliefs and feelings. The humour then has an inappropriate and insensitive use, making people feel uncomfortable.\nDrug/alcohol abuse, sex addiction and/or perversion & other extreme forms of lack of self-control.\n\n\u200b\nIt is mainly the humour and destructive habits I am seeing and feeling in myself. I still eat an excess of sugary foods to the point of feeling uncomfortable and then I exercise to burn it off. A complete waste of energy really but I actually love every part of it. There is a secret enjoyment in it otherwise I would not be drawn to this experience over and over.\nIt is my assumption that this is some stage of integration and that more lies ahead.\nCan anyone share any views? Perhaps someone has experienced this before or as the title says, can give me an antidote?\nIt's as though I don't currently want to embody or even look at positive aspects of myself. Perhaps this is now where I need to go with shadow work? Just writing this last part I felt some activation in my heart so maybe this is key.\n\n"}, {"title": "Jungian Literature Inquiry (self.Jung)", "likes": "3", "comments": "5", "content": "I\u2019m fairly unfamiliar with Carl Jung as I\u2019ve only studied brief bits about his philosophies and works in a few of my psychology classes.

Frothing at the mouth, brutal and hyper-aggressive reasoning.   The kind of beings who eminate constant threat, even if they arent directly trying to threaten you at the time.  In this way you know a person, but do not know them.  They are reasoning, but that reasoning is not rational, but a thing motivated by violence.\nI remember that there was blood everywhere.  That people had died and parts of them were consumed or being comsumed by the aspects I was familiar with what you could call the rabid ones\", the aspects of violence.\nI think I was in a hotel?  I also get the impression there was a body in a suitcase, and there was definitely dead victims of the aspects or, those upon which it had predated, either after finding them desd or causing their death. \nThere is also the feeling of a wound on my hand, or fingers.

Its female when it is on, its face is ceiled, there is medium length hair, a mouth with the lips curled back over teeth, red and sharp, the mouth snarls and wants to bite.) \nSomething is to be done about the dead (?). Those who are its \"victims\".

Maybe that it has the capacity to? Or maybe its a warning about something out here? \nRabies is a huge theme.  I mean a severely dominant theme. RABIES, and not just the prime entity.  There were animals, I think.  Lower ones which were \"infected.\"  They were eating those higher level organisms, the dead. \nCuriously, one of them gives the impression of a deer.

I know the door must be passed through to get there.  But it is a door to a world, not a door to that room, specifically.  The red door stands alone in darkness, mist tumbles around it. \nThe door is open if I dont share info that isnt supposed to be shared.   \nFor context, recently Ive been trying to find proof the collective unconscious exists, recently.   Humoring the idea of denying that the unconcsious exists at all, only levels of consciousness which lack conext or meaning. \nThoughts?\nEdit: the table cloth is yellow, the flower is white. \nThe walls have wood color on them. The carpet (in the other room but also in the room of the one ehich veils its face and shows only a womans hair and teeth is in.) \nShe crouches, but also is right next to my ear, she wants me to know shes right next to my throat.

Over the past several months, I have read Modern Man in Search of Soul and The Undiscovered Self, and although these books have brought me a much greater understanding of the inner workings of the psyche, I am still infantile in my grasp of jungian phycology (especially as it pertains to archetypes and the process of individuation).\nRegardless, this deeper understanding has increased my own awareness around my own behavior, and while in quarantine I have realized something about myself - i have been searching for recognition and social validation.\nI am 21 years old and am figuring out the path I will walk over the next decade. The issue is, whenever I imagine an avatar of myself going down a career path, rather than picturing myself doing the work and how if I would enjoy it, I fantasize about the recognition and the glory i would receive as the outcome of doing it. For example, if i picture myself pursuing a career in writing, fantasies of the praise i would get from publishing something special come into my mind, rather than the process and lifestyle of being a writer.\nI grew up, and still exist within, a very chaotic household (father was a drug addict who passed away when i was 17, episodes of domestic abuse, communication issues), and looking back on my life, i believe i have been unconsciously attempting to fill the void of family love with social love and status. My ambitions has always been fueled to make myself worthy in the eyes of others because I have never felt worthy in the eye of myself.\nThis realization, on top of many others, have led me to attempt to dive into my shadow and put light to the darkness. I recently started doing what i have named, \"shadow sessions,\" with myself, where I spend 1-2 hours journaling with brutal honesty and facing my darkness with attempts to uncover it. Like I said, I don't know much about this process yet, so my question is, is this helpful? Is there some specific guidelines i should try to follow to ensure I am truly moving through and illuminating the darkness within me, rather than just ruminating on past issues and making myself feel worse? Is this worth it or am I wasting my time?\nAgain, I am new to this, so if this question doesn't align with the rules or aim of this sub-reddit I apologize.

When I've seeing her behaviour paterns, I started to relate to her, to only at the end to have huge crush on this character, the end result is, I started to fully identify as that character, as if the character is me. To note out, I am male in real life, saying this just to mention it for those who will think I am female, I'm not.\nWith this in mind, I felt a huge mental release. I somehow started to think very clearly and intuitively, as if I fully mastered my intuition, it just felt so supernatural, like out of this world. But at the same time, I felt huge anxiety and completely loosen my appetite, as if I dont feel hunger no more, even though I didnt eat anything to warrant that. When I went to sleep it became so difficult to fall asleep because of the insane anxiety I was experiencing for no reason, but as I was dozing off later, I started seeing dream imagery.\nWith this imagery, I've seen a kid lying inside a wooden tree (spaced out), as he is getting up and facing the sun with full embrase, as the sun is rising up. There was a wall at the side, there we're the words \"Id, Ego, Superego\", where underneath the word ego, there was an arrow pointing down, as if the ego has fallen.\nBefore those this event of identification with an Anime Girl character, I was experiencing some sort of sorrow, or worry as if I had rejected myself, that my visions and ideals to follow are unrealistic and judged by others as bad. With this, I had other dream imagery (Well 4):\nIt was space, I was in a random place in a galaxy densily populated by stars. The imagery shown me 2 objects standing near each other in the opposite of my view; A black hole and a White hole. The blackhole was obviously black, bending light around and twitching in a creepy way, to the opposite there was a White hole, flashing out white light.\nPhysical Representation:  https://i.imgur.com/XhmpMGy.png \nThe second dream imagery, had an image of Ariel the little mermaid. The image was set at night, with almost full moon fully shining down into the sea, Ariel was however not in the sea, she was at some pool instead, she is looking at the moon, with sad expression\nPhysical Representation (I apologize for my shit drawing skills):  https://i.imgur.com/OrZLvN4.png \nThe third dream imagery, was set in some random street in the city I live in the setting was full night, with street lights turned on. On the otherside of the street, we're stairs. From the stairs was coming down an Anime Girl, as she is moving in closer, she started flashing pure white light at me (Similar to the Light from the White hole in the first Dream imagery). The Anime girl looked 100% exactly like this:  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1l2Utt2gEpQ/maxresdefault.jpg (In the left side, the female character. Ignore the Skeleton in the right side, It's unrelated).\nNow 4th Dream imagery, it looked like some abandoned building, there are stairs leading to some fully pitch dark basement, from the dark Red, monster like eyes appeared, the following phrase was heard \"She is a victim.\", actualy it was my own thought as I was dozing off to sleep.\nPhysical representation:  https://i.imgur.com/KIZcd4B.png\n\n"}, {"title": " What is the Anima?

(self.Jung)", "likes": "1", "comments": "2", "content": "This may be a long post but I think it's all relevant to the story. \n I'm 28 year old male in a happy May - December relationship. She has completely changed my world perspective and has helped my soul evolve. However my S/O is not the topic I just gave you that for co text. \n\nWhen I was in middle school I developed a strong attraction to a girl name Mary (Fake Name). I really liked her and I (know) she liked me. We flirted in class all the time but it was the 8th grade and honestly, all I thought about was having sex with every girl I saw. I think relationships are hard to build upon when that's going on. \n\nThe next next four years Mary and I had limited contact we each other. It wasn't until our senior year of high school that we had another class. My feelings for her never faded and (I don't think) her feelings for me faded either. She was still beautiful and the same person overall but I was...husky/fat and extremely introverted at this time. And to be honest I was beyond high school and it's superficial social system. Anyways, that year came and went. Mary and I became good class friends again but after graduation she moved away and was physically out of my life like 99.9% of the rest of my class. \n\n  For the next eight years I would hear every so often about where Mary was and what she was doing. I would be glad to hear about her and hoped she was doing well. However, during these same eight years Mary would manifest in my dreams on a semi-reoccuring basis. The feelings that accompanied these dreams were joy, love, and a yearning to see her but I never came close to contacting her in any way. Our lives had taken different paths and I doubt she felt the same. \n\n Flash forward to (May 2019), two of my friends Tom and Mark were coming up for a weekend. I hadn't seen them in a while, especially Mark who I hadn't contacted in over a year. Tom tells me the week before they're coming up that it won't be just them two but Mark is coming up with wait for it...Mary. Apparently they had been in a relationship for over a year. \n\n When I read the text I must admit I was completely stunned and even afraid. But I processed the new information and an hour later I came to feel excited to see Mary again. FYI, I felt no betrayal towards Mark because neither he nor Tom nor anyone else except my S/O really knew I liked Mary all those years ago. I keep a lot of things to myself and only one-two people knows about the Mary dreams. The whole first night I was anxious.\n    \"What is she like now? Is she happy? I want to\n     Tell her about the dreams. Wait no, don't do that\n     Stupid\". \n\n  By the day of our get together I had overcome my anxiety. I have lost a lot of weight since high school and I can say objectively that I'm fairly handsome. Also my confidence and overall state of being has evolved WAY beyond the high school part of me so I'm pretty good with myself and I was at ease with whole situation. I did have some nerves but overall I was thankful for the opportunity to see Mary again. \n\n   We all met at a restaurant. She looked relativilly the same. Of course 9 years older but still beautiful. (This next part is especially essential to the story). When we started talking I couldn't get over how she sounded. Her voice seemed...different. at least different than I remembered. It was her speech pattern. The way she spoke certain words with added emotions seemed inauthentic to me. I found it slightly annoying. And ten minutes into the conversation I could tell she cared more about how she was perceived much more than I do. This dinner interaction was a big eye-opener for me. After the dinner we all walked around before the movie started. Mary and I continued to talk while Mark and Tom talked. This was fun too but I could see just how far beyond her I had gone. Then we all met again the next day for a hike and a walk downtown. Again, Mary and I talked more about our lives and again it was really nice but I continued to feel more evolved than her. Overall, I ascertained that Mary is insecure and that she cares about matters I think are more trivial. That said she is also a very nice person with an open mind and an empathetic heart . As I watched them drive away I was still left feeling physically attracted to Mary and I wanted nothing but the best for her and Mark, but I just felt too far beyond her psychologically, emotionally, and spirititually.\n\nFor the next month after that weekend, I thought little about Mary and I don't think she came to me in any dreams. Nonetheless, on some random night she appeared in my dream reawakening those same feelings from before. She continued to pop up more often until I would say three months ago that she started manifesting in my dreams at the same rate as before that weekend. (FINALLY IM GETTING TO MY QUESTIONs). \n\nI believe in soul evolution. I''m a mature/old soul and I know that I'm further along than Mary and that if we were in a relationship I know I would struggle with her less experienced soul, but can anyone tell me why I dream about her so often? Why do those profound and deep joyful, loving emotions swell within my when I see her after waking from a dream?   Do I really love her even after that weekend? Or does she represent some inner aspect within me? \nI really don't know but I would love to hear interpretations and suggestions.

(self.Jung)", "likes": "82", "comments": "14", "content": "I just had one of the probably most meaningful experiences of my life and I would love to hear your views on it.\n2 months ago I did a retreat that got me really into my own body and connected with my feelings and emotions. I was like a walking feeling-radar and I felt like I perceived the world through my feeling-body, if that makes sense.\nOne of the things we did a few times was this Osho kundalini meditation where for 15 minutes you let yourself shake and then for the next 15 minutes you dance to music. The first thing I noticed about this when I did it the first time is that it gets me really connected with the presence of my (feeling)body.\nThat dancing in the last few days of the retreat got very physical and visceral. Where in the beginning of the retreat I had still been concerned with how my dancing looked i.e. how beautiful it was as if I were in a club trying to advertise myself, in the last few days I was just dancing and moving on the energy in my body. Fuck looking beautiful. I felt like every move I made, or felt the urge to make, meant something. And I started to have these symbolic visions while dancing. At some point had this vision-feeling of being this great tree that had it's roots into the earth and it was sucking in all this live energy into itself from the earth to then spewing it onto everyone else I was there with, as a kind of 'tree of life' act or desire. At another time I had this vision-feeling of feeling like this great oriental warrior standing strongly in squat pose and I had this tube of nectar in my body that ran from from genital area all the way to my neck and these small people would come to me to get the nectar and I would let them, while remaining very strong.\nAnd I would express those feeling-visions in my dance by the way I held my body and moved. In a sense actually embodying that which I felt as a kind of symbolic vision.\nNow, I had read Jung about a year ago, but nothing like this had ever happened to me, it was quite novel, and the retreat itself in no way made any references to this kind of stuff at all so I wasn't be massaged to get visions or anything. The retreat itself was mostly about getting into contact with your (repressed) feelings and emotions let's say.\nAnyway, this all felt VERY satisfying. As if some hidden aspect of my psyche was being discovered.\nThen at the last time we did this Osho kundalini meditation I was dancing again and suddenly this big cobra appeared in front of me - huge, like 4 meters in height at least - and she had a female face. She was dancing with me. And while we danced with each other, she started bitingly attacking me while I was evading her by moving to the sides while dancing. But it wasn't like she was attacking me to kill. It was like she was attacking me to give me a message. And while I was scared of her and on guard, I was at the same time mesmerized by her and very strongly drawn to her. As if I needed her very deeply. Or needed something from her. I felt even in some sense prepared to let her attack me and kill me if only that meant I would get from her what I - in some sense - desperately wanted. Was it sex? (she moved very sensually). Was it love? Maybe, but a dangerous kind of love. An unsafe kind of love. I did not know exactly what it was but we kept dancing for minutes and then the music stopped and she was gone. Before she was gone I asked her \"what do you want. What are you here to tell me? What are you guarding?\" But no answer.\nThis all felt very meaningful. I felt like I had actually encountered an entity. And the fact that she was female seemed very important. As was the fact that she was a snake, an imposing cobra, to be precise.\nEvery since that retreat she had been in my mind. And about a month later I met her again while doing the same dance to the same music in my living room. And again the same dynamic.\nAfterwards, I realized that I felt very strongly that her femaleness and way of being were archetypically representative of both my mother and my ex girlfriend who I was (am) still in contact with. Needing something from them desperately which they are the guardians of but at the same time always on the watch for the danger, the unpredictableness of the snakebite, of the pain.\nI've since told this (to some people very weird and 'out there') story to some people, a testament that it was still in my mind. But I didn't feel like I had gotten anything out of it except for the opening up to this dimension in myself and being able to have met this being at all. I could not figure out any message or lesson from it (her).\nThen today I had taken a microdose of psylocibin mushrooms (0.2grams. Which means I am not tripping in the slightest, yet I feel somewhat more connected to myself and existence but in such small amounts that you could very easily convince me that it was a placebo if you had administered it to me) and I was sitting with myself, meditating, looking at myself in the mirror and trying to give myself love. While I was focusing on my body to get closer to my felt-sense of being, I felt the urge to get up try to do that via dancing again. So I started moving, quietly without music, and after a few moments there she was, the female cobra. As big and alive as she had always been. And with the realization of her felt representation of my mother and ex girlfriend. I started to feel that this was in a way how I was relating to all women I encounter. That there is something about them that I desperately need or want or desire, but that it always comes paired with danger and guardedness for being bitten.\nAnd then a girl popped into into my head that I had met last week in a workshop. We at some point sat next to each other after not have exchanged any words for 2 days in the group, and I again felt a reluctance to speak with her. So I looked at her, and when she looked at me, I mustered the nerve to say the most honest thing I could at that moment and I asked her \"Is there something going on between us?\" And after having both focused on the energy between us, she agreed, although we could both not pinpoint what it was exactly, although we both agreed that It felt both very good but also a little dangerous. Like a bungee jump would feel. That afternoon we hugged, and we could not let go for what was probably a good 3 minutes. Which is a long time for an actual hug if you think about it.\nI've been chatting with her on whatsapp for the past week and we will meet up next week to explore what the hell this thing between us actually is.\nAnyway, back to the cobra I was just dancing with, feeling that she represented something about how I felt towards all women I encountered. And I realized she might be the negative aspect of my anima.\nAfter that I started to project the 'danger' I had felt with this girl last week as also an aspect of the danger of that cobra. And when I did that, it felt absolutely completely off. Wrong. Inaccurate in every sense.\nHere was this aspect of this human being, this rather beautiful girl, that in no way fit onto the archetype that was standing before me.\nAnd when I realized that (and I am getting goosebumps typing this out). Something happened. The cobra became smaller. Until she had lost everything that was threatening about it. It seemed kind of hilarious to me that this is what I had been afraid off, but at the same time so hopelessly drawn to. A little fucking snake. As if I had to realize or encounter another aspect in this girl that would make me realize that the cobra was not the whole picture... I guess?\nAt this point I decided to turn on the music that I knew so well from the retreat and continue dancing to that.\nMy mind gave me a sort of heads-up in a way that the cobra would change into something different (and this all happened in a manner of seconds) so I was prepared for something to come. But the cobra did not change. It remained. And what appeared in front of me, within a short few moments, was this woman with piercing eyes, like the famous National Geographic fotograph of that child. She looked somewhat middle eastern (I am from the Netherlands) although I could not clearly see her face because it was partly veiled in this beautifully white radiant, almost godly fabric.\nAnd as soon as that face appeared, she receded a ways back, standing next to the cobra, in full body, and I realized; that cobra was her guardian. Her Pet(!), in some sense. And next to this cobra was this absolutely magnificently radiant woman, dressed all in white, mysteriously veiled, with radiant pieces of cloth wavering all about, as if in the wind, with a presence that\u2026 Fucking hell\u2026\nI asked myself, but obviously with her knowing (as if anything could ever escape her) \"who are you?\"\nAre you my mother\u2026? No you're not.\nAre you my ex girlfriend\u2026? No, you're not.\nAre you the girl from last week\u2026? No, you're not.\nAnd then a second or two it was quiet, and then the word grandmother appeared.\nAnd I was like, \"grandmother?\" with both of my grandmothers flashing before my eyes: No.\nAre you the grandmother? No. You don't look anything like a grandmother any way.\nAnd then I realized\u2026 She was the Grand-Mother. The Grand fucking mother. The omega.\nAnd I went down to my knees and I bowed to her. There was absolutely nothing about myself that I could ever even dream of hiding from her. And there was nothing that she didn't accept in me.\nShe was\u2026. Man\u2026 To say she was incredibly beautiful would be like calling the Mona Lisa a cute little drawing.\nI felt absolutely exposed in the most satisfying way possible. And my first instinct was indeed to go on my knees and worship her.\nAnd then she told to \"get up\", in a way that signified that what I was doing in that moment wasn't necessary.\nSo I got up. And as I was standing, the wordless question arose that said as much as \"what am I to do with you? In which box can I place you?\" And the feeling of that question become loaded with examples: should I place you in the 'Mother' box? Should I place you in the 'lover' box?\nAnd as soon as this sense of not knowing what to 'do' with her arose, she knew I had asked it, for again, there was nothing to hide from her, and as soon as I had felt that question burning, she opened her robe and showed me her absolutely, perfect beautiful naked body with her robe with a 1000 cloth pieces wavering in the wind at her back and her body and tits perked out, as an answer to that question. She was fucking powerful beyond belief. And I could have taken her if I wanted to, but only because she would let me, because it would be one of the reasons (but not the reason) I had been created as a man in the first place. And that was all I needed to know. I felt no need to take her. Although I felt a strong need to be in her presence.\nHer body was other-worldy beautiful and desirable, and with her showing of it she answered in an instant the question I had posed.\n\"I am all. I am that which has created you, which nurtures you, which protects you, which gives you strength, which roots for you, and I am that which you can reflect your own manliness into if you so, or when, you desire. I am what you need. And I want you to be what I need.\" - She told me as I was still moving my body to the music in the background.\nMy whole body filled with this enormously satisfying energy, and she told me to finally be a full man in the face of womanhood and the world at large. To be strong, to be manly, to also be gentle, and supple and soft and caring and feminine. To be a man, but even more important to be a human being, in the face of the world, in the face of females in the face of other males. That it would be no use to hide either my masculinity or my femininity for she sees anyway, she knows. And all of this she was telling me from a place of other-worldy support and love to be my absolute self. My absolute real self. That there would be nothing more manly, more humanly to do than that, to show my strength and my weakness. And with the incredible wisdom and fiercety and love and support with which she said it, I knew I was in the right hands to actually be that person. To be in the right hands for the first time in my life.\nAs I am typing this I have been crying on and off, and I still feel her presence with me, she is here with me. As a new example of all that is feminine and wants to draw out the masculine (the true masculine) at the same time. And\u2026 I am home\u2026\nAnd even now, I feel her. She doesn't want me to do anything. Not worship her, not show my attractiveness or manliness to her. She wants nothing except for me to be as I was intended to be.\nThis radiant white clothed being that you do not want to fuck with but has absolute support in every aspect of me being human.\nGod I hope she'll remains here\u2026\nEDIT: Jezus christ... 10 minutes after writing this my mother who I haven't seen in about a year and haven't spoken to in a few months sends me a message...\n\u200b\nEDIT2: Grammar and typos.\n\n"}, {"title": "interpreting my own poems using intellectual and spiritual approach (self.Jung)", "likes": "7", "comments": 0, "content": "This is very long. it\u2019s literally me reporting myself while spacing out to a childhood trauma (which I didn\u2019t know is a trauma) during writing this post\nI know how some may say you gotta do these things spirituality, but I think the intellectual approach is really helping me, alongside with the spiritual approach. \nYou know, in Iran, some of our historic poets insist on using both your \u201cHeart\u201d and your \u201cMind\u201d. There were some who believed the \u201cHeart\u201d way was the only way and they were some who were only pro \u201cMind\u201d. Some would say the heart sees what the mind understands and vice versa. But some insisted that guys, guys, you are all right, you have to use both \u201cHeart\u201d and \u201cMind\u201d. \nSo I guess now during my self-therapy, I\u2019m heeding their guideline. I do intellectual research with 15 minute meditations. Then I write to record valuable information about my unconscious for my future self. Cause I may not understand their meaning yet, but I know she will. Cause the mind is slower than the heart. \nThese days I\u2019m finding answers in the works of art my past self has stored for me without knowing what valuable thing she\u2019s doing for me (or maybe she does?)\nEver-since I learned writing, I started to write. \n7-12: Childish stories about animals and stuff. \n12-19: very disturbing long and short and edgy stories + tons of diary notes which mostly consists of poetic texts describing the way my thoughts hurt me!\n19\u201323: lots of love and depression poems + again poetic texts nagging about my mood and my thoughts + a very detailed diary of half of 19 + most of 22 \n24: which is now. \nI\u2019m currently going through all these \u201cmemoirs\u201d I like to call them, trying to find clues to interpret what my subconscious shows me. So I guess interpreting my own \u201cart\u201d while reading about psychology, is my intellectual approach and clues I get from my subconscious is my spiritual approach. \nFor example, I keep seeing scary eyes in my meditations. I find that 4 years ago I\u2019ve written a poem about eyes:\n(An awkward english translation of my persian poem:\nI don\u2019t know how not to see \u2018the eyes\u2019\nAnd worse than that,\nI don\u2019t know how to close my eyes.\nOnly hate, \nand those escaping pupils, which are flowing in their prison.)\nJust translating this made me shake and goosebumps! This is how my subconscious lets me know I\u2019ve found something that hints to her problem. \nImagine a 4 year old kid talking to a teenage metalhead, telling her to tell me this: Elham (my sister) makes me see her scary eyes cause I can\u2019t close my eyes and just go to sleep. (I hear the sound of my mom telling me to just close your eyes). But what I\u2019m doing (disturbing my family\u2019s sleep) is worse than what my sister is doing (scaring me cause mom told her). So I hate myself, and then my pupils start getting dizzy (maybe caused by a trance to escape the fear) and I go to sleep.\nMy teenage me coded this in a poem and sent it to me. Word by word. While hinting to her own need to escape. \nI was a scared child, i guess that\u2019s what the gift of imagination brings for your childhood.\nI was scared of every corner cause my mind would show me black shadows with scary eyes. It still shows me this image when I turn off the lights.\nMy family found this weakness/strength (fear/imagination) and used it against me,\nMy mom would tell me I have to sleep, otherwise the \u201cYesar2goush\u201d would eat me up. \nMy sister had big beautiful black eyes with a long unibrow, She would cover her face with a blanket and show me scary eyes, playing the part of \u201cYesar2goush\u201d.\nIt was their tactic for making me go to sleep.\nAs an adult, I struggle with sleeping too much and I constantly blame myself for it which results in a constant self-hate and guilt trip. Some days I even sleep for for more than 17 hours. My average is 12 hours.\nIt\u2019s like two feelings and one external factor are tied in my subconscious: fear, guilt and sleep.\nfeel guilty about not being able to sleep fast while getting scared by your mom and your sister, go to sleep to \u201cescape\u201d the fear and stop the guilt.\nIt happens vice versa in adulthood.\nI get scared of the tasks of life, I sleep to escape the fear, I feel guilty about sleeping too much. \nNo wondering I dream so much of escaping. \nI also have lots of poems with the concept of escaping. During my teen years, I had written \u201cI want an escape\u201d in almost all my poetic texts and during my 23 I wrote this piece about how there is no hope for an escape and no energy to escape.\nMy whole life I\u2019ve been doing what they did to me during childhood. \nAnd there...\nNow I know what to search for in my next meditation.\nEdit: I read some chapters of a long story I wrote when I was 12. The eye analogies are numerous in that story but I was shocked by its title the most: A sister from Hell. I was surprised to find that the hellish sister in the story wasn\u2019t a symbol of my own sister, it was a depiction of my adhd traits.\nAlso I remembered how my mom would play \u201cthe guardian\u201d while telling my sister to bring Yesar2goosh.\nEdit 2: I just realised that just a few weeks ago, i suddenly updated my instagram bio to \u201cOne is sleeping out of fear and the other is being kept awake by her dreams\u201d.  I didn\u2019t think of it much then, but it makes so much sense now.\n\n"}, {"title": "My Opinion on the Replication Crisis (self.Jung)", "likes": "15", "comments": "20", "content": "If I must be honest, I believe that the replication crisis is inevitable and I will explain why.

Culture evolves faster than our biology. We create new systems of meaning and let go of old ones. We encounter new life experiences that change us. We experience traumatic events that cause us to reevaluate our place in the world. We develop new dances, new interests, new behaviors, new values, and new beliefs. \nIf we were to travel 2,000 years back in time with all the up-to-date research we have in psychology, we would realize that the majority of our studies would fail to replicate.

A time when people believed in magic, curses, lived their life based on symbolic ideas of meaning. There isn't any way that our studies would replicate. \nFast forward 1,000 years into the future, the world and all cultures will be so vastly different that our present studies will be considered outdated and not useful. In that time span, so many things can happen in the world such as another world war, famine, space travel, etc. that it will greatly impact the way people understand, precieve, and behave in the world or the universe. The only way to study this change in behavior would be through phenomenological research, which I know carries its own problems and receives much hate from the psychology community as \"not scientific.\" \nBut this post wasn't meant to bash anyone or devalue anyone's research. It wasn't meant to make the argument that psychology is not a science. In fact we are a science and we are a hard one at that but we keep trying to follow the footsteps of the other reputable sciences instead of formulating a different way to study psychology.\nWhat I think is awesome about all the research that we've done now is that it gives us a clue on how our psyche worked during our time period. We archive all this information that people will read years from now. It gives them a sneak peek about how our brain functioned during our time period. \nWe are recording and documenting psychic phenomenon in real time as it happens and creating a history of the evolution of human conciousness that will be so useful for those in the future.\nThat is so damn cool to think about! And I want to say that you guys are awesome and doing a good job! So don't let the idea of a Replication Crisis frustrate you when it seems like it's meant to happen due to dynamical changes in the human species.\nEdit: I made this post under r/Jung because r/AcademicPsychology keeps rejecting my post. I've always been a fan Jung and the subreddit so I thought you guys would appreciate it a little more anyways.\n\n"}, {"title": "Jungian podcasts (self.Jung)", "likes": "49", "comments": "10", "content": "A few Jungian podcasts I thought the community would enjoy.  \nFirst, Alaln Mulhern's The Quest is excellent.  The most recent episode is about the last days of Jung's life, it is incredible, but I suggest going to the beginning of the Jung series.  The first episodes of the podcast are an overview of Jungian worldview and therapy. The second series is a study of great thinkers taht illustrate the psychic conflicts of our time, episodes include deep meditations on thinkers as diverse as Richard Dawkings, Teilhard de Chardin, and Jung himself.  The ultimate aim of this series is to achieve some kind of synthesis of these divergent ideas, in a way that will bring a measure of psychic healing and  evolution to the modern world.   Mulhern is a fully trained, practicing Jungian analyst.\nSpeaking of Jung is an interview series with Jungian analysts, it is absolutely excellent.  \nShrink Rap Radio is a weekly interview with authors in all areas of psychology, but the host takes a strong interest in Jung.  Linked episode is highly Jungian, there are many.  \nFinally, I think Living Thelema fits under the rubric of Jungian podcasts, as the author is a clinical psychologist who works in Jungian models (not a graduate of one of the Jung institutes)  Thelema is a branch of Ceremonial Magic, in the Hermetic tradition of the alchemists Jung studied.  It gets quite deep into kabbalistic jargon and practice, but the core message and practice are entirely compatible with Jung's vision.  I've linked to an episode on the Holy Guardian Angel.  I chose this episode because it maps directly to Jung's concept of the Self, and also because it is in some ways a better explanation.  Upon first reading, one can think of the Self as \"a better version of me if I cleaned up my room and hit the gym more often\", but from the ego's perspective it is really closer to an angel.\nAll are available through podcatchers, I've linked to youtube versions of some because they're easy to access on any platform.  If anyone knows about others, I hope you'll post them.\n\n"}, {"title": "Free PDF of The Complete Collected Works of C.G.

Meaning and purposefulness are not the prerogatives of the mind; they operate in the whole of living nature. There is no difference in principle between organic and psychic growth. As a plant produces its flower, so the psyche creates its symbols.\n\n\u200b\nJust beautiful.\n\u200b\n\n"}], []]}
