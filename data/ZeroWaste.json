Like Polyester reusable produce bags. Polyester, Nylon, Acrylic- all plastic. (self.ZeroWaste)", "likes": "101", "comments": "19", "content": "More than ever, our clothes are made of plastic. Just washing them can pollute the oceans. How much plastic is your washing machine sending out to sea?\nMost of the plastic products we use end up in the ocean, but how much of it are you unaware of? One major source of pollution is in clothes and some businesses that are now selling reusable mesh produce bags under the name \u201cZero Waste\u201d online are made of micro-plastics. \nPolyester, nylon, acrylic and other synthetic fibers \u2014 all of which are forms of plastic \u2014 are now about 60 percent of the material that makes up our clothes worldwide. Synthetic plastic fibers are cheap and extremely versatile, they provide stretch breathability, warmth and sturdiness in winter clothes all fibers contribute to ocean plastic pollution in a subtle but pervasive way: \nThe fabrics they make, along with synthetic/natural blends leach into the environment just by being washed. Estimates vary, but it\u2019s possible that a single load of laundry could release hundreds of thousands of fibers from our clothes into the water supply.\nAnd these tiny fibers \u2014 less than 5 millimeters in length, with diameters measured in micrometers (one-thousandth of a millimeter) \u2014 can eventually reach the ocean. There, they\u2019re adding to the microplastic pollution that\u2019s accumulating in the food chain and being ingested by all sorts of marine wildlife, and even us. Most of the plastic that\u2019s in the ocean, in terms of number of pieces, is not in the form of whole products like cups or straws, but instead broken-down shreds of plastic.\n\u201cThink about how many people are washing their clothes on a daily basis, and how many clothes we all have,\u201d says Imogen Napper, a marine scientist at the University of Plymouth who co-authored a 2016 study on the plastic fibers that shed from our clothing. \u201cEven when we\u2019re walking around, not washing our clothes, tiny fibers are falling off. It\u2019s everywhere.\u201d\nWorldwide, there are now vigorous efforts to reduce the use of some of the products that end up in the oceans, like plastic cups and shopping bags. (Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of plastic straw bans.) As we seek solutions to the overall issue of plastic pollution, we need to recognize that our clothing is a major part of the problem and will need to be part of the solution as well.\nMuch of the microplastic problem is a plastic clothing problem\nConsider the lint you collect in the dryer. That lint is tiny bits of thread from your clothing that have become dislodged and are caught by a mesh screen.\nSimilarly, synthetic fibers come off in the wash \u2014 but they\u2019re so small, and there\u2019s no filter inside the machines to catch them. Instead, these tiny plastic fibers pass through to sewage treatment plants, which often don\u2019t have filters fine enough to catch them. (And if they do, the fibers may end up in another sewage byproduct: fertilizer.) Treated wastewater is then often dumped into rivers or the sea, carrying plastic clothing fibers with it, as a 2011 study found.\nIn 2016, Napper and a colleague designed a test to see how many of these fibers could be shed in the wash. They fitted a Whirlpool front-loading washing machine with a special filter to collect tiny fibers. They tested swatches of three types of fabric: a polyester-cotton blend T-shirt, a polyester hoodie, and an acrylic sweater. After a few washes (all garments shed more when they are brand new), the acrylic fabric shed the most, followed by the polyester, and then the poly-cotton blend.\nChristina Animashaun/Vox\n\u201cWe found that in a typical wash, 700,000 fibers could come off,\u201d Napper said. Other studies have come up with different estimates. One 2011 paper found 1,900 fibers could be released from a single synthetic garment in a wash; another effort estimated 1 million fibers could be released from washing polyester fleece.\nIt\u2019s hard to pin down the exact amount of plastic pollution per load because there are so many variables that may contribute to fibers shedding or not: garment construction, materials used, water temperature, detergent type, fabric softener, how full the machine is, etc. One study found that top-loading washing machines releases seven times the microfibers as front loaders.\nSee full article, by Brian Resnick \nfrom VoxMedia\nHow Much Plastic in Your Clothes are you Washing out to Sea?\n\n"}, {"title": "Anyone know any good tealight alternatives?

It's so frustrating, because all they're doing is grossly misinterpreting a statistic. The 71% includes the USAGE of the fossil fuels, meaning it accounts for the emissions from driving a car, flying on a plane, making a plastic bag, etc. In fact, if they removed the consumer impact and only took into account the emissions companies are directly responsible for (i.e. those released during the manufacturing process), the 71% would be reduced to just 7%. Not to mention that these companies only exist because we as consumers demand their services. Richard Heede (the man behind the statistic) even said that individual action plays a role in fighting climate change! \nIndividual action should be done alongside government legislation, corporate change, etc, but that should not be conflated with the idea that individual action does nothing. In fact, I've noticed that government legislation can worsen the problem if consumers don't change as well. Just look at the latest plastic bag ban. Reusable bags are only better if they are actually being used long enough to offset their initial footprint, but people were just going out and buying like 30 of them that they would forget to use! It's estimated that in San Francisco, the footprint actually grew because people weren't using them long enough to justify their use. Not to mention, we just replaced plastic bags with paper bags, which are just as bad (paper has a greater initial footprint and releases methane in landfills).\nThe issue is that our fundamental habits of consumerism have not changed. We are doing the same thing that we did with plastic to other materials, which is treating something that should be reused as disposable. Plastic in of itself is not a bad material, but we should not be using it in the amounts that we are, and it certainly should not be considered disposable when it lasts for like 500 years. instead of trying to buy our way to sustainability, we need to buy less and buy meaningfully (i.e. not buying an excessive number of reusable bags). In order to fight climate change, instead of pointing fingers and saying, \"it's the [corporations, government, China] that's responsible, not me\", we should recognize that we all have a role to play and try to do as much as we can in the 10 years we have (according to the UN) before the effects of climate change become irreversible. \nTldr: Individual action matters.\nP.S. I know that posting this here is like preaching to the choir, but hopefully this serves as ammunition if someone tries to discredit individual action (which has happened almost every time it's become known that I'm zero waste. \ud83d\ude44) Hopefully that behavior becomes less common and that mindset changes as time progresses.\nEdit: Thank you guys so much for the positive response and the awards! I didn't expect this to get so big. :)\nEdit 2: I should probably clarify that the 100 companies include mostly fossil fuel corporations, like Exxon. If you want to check out the report yourself, just search up the Carbon Majors Report 2017. Also, I wasn't trying to undermine the impact that these big corporations have. They have done so many unethical things, funded misleading studies, lobbied for or against legislation to fit their needs, etc. To emphasize, individual action should be done ALONGSIDE holding these corporations accountable (among other things)! This post was mostly to combat the misconception that \"individual action doesn't do anything\", which is why I focused so much on that.\n\n"}], [{"title": "The bread bag story (self.ZeroWaste)", "likes": "410", "comments": "49", "content": "So, a few months ago, maybe somewhere around april or may, I made myself a bread bag tailored for the whole grain bread of my local bakery.
