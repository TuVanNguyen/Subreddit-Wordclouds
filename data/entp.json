And  the major stuff  : Dislike of Physical contact.\nI have no idea whether this is Inferior Si, or if I'm just fucked up mentally, but I dislike friendly intimacy, like touches that people do when laughing together, hugs, pushes, taps, you get it. \nI mean, when I got into college, I was super social, talking to everyone, but as soon the \"physical plays\" like pushes, taps, etc, I taked that as bullying or so, due to past highschool experiences, and isolated myself.\nStereotype asides, I find this really weird, enjoying exploring the world and meeting people, doing stuff, being in parties, debating, but somehow reluctant of physical touch. I don't know if I'm INTP or ENTP only due do this duality.\n\n"}, {"title": " Keeping old stuff (from school, 'the past', etc) - do you fellow ENTPs tend to keep stuff like this? Do you ever go back to it and if so, do you toss it out much later? And any sense of nostalgia? (self.entp)", "likes": "18", "comments": "10", "content": "Hey, so I am currently confined to the house because of virus related lockdown and taking the opportunity to go all Marie Kondo and finally clear out my shit. I've been feeling for a long time that the amount of mess around me is a burden on my state of mental wellbeing*, as it seems quite 'oppressive' and so on... but somehow always a little too lazy to do anything about it. I left home at 18 and I'm now 37, and while I don't think I still have anything from the original \"my first place\", I have been in the habit of boxing up miscellaneous stuff and moving it from place to place, rather than purging as I went.\n[* I am always hyper-aware of my surroundings, have above average situational awareness and so on. It isn't anything \"new age\" about being burdened down by possessions but more literally that I don't have a clear field of vision... everything in a 180 degrees around me is mess.]\nIt's a major point of conflict between me and my (INTJ) partner, who has a much more \"minimalist\" approach, and also he went through a similar phase about 5 years ago in which he tossed out all his stuff and basically started again. He doesn't understand why I would keep anything from exes, school, etc. (He also doesn't see how it is possible to remain friends with exes, which is a whole other thing!)\nI wouldn't categorise myself as a \"hoarder\" -- although my house (when I lived on my own) might have resembled some of those 'Hoarders' tv programs it's a different motivation ... often I just can't find the energy to throw things out, but when I get into the mood for it I am quite happy to toss things. I don't hold on to them just because \"this might be useful in the future\" or \"fear of scarcity\" or stuff like that. If I could pay a \"professional declutterer\" to come and help me out I would, but my INTJ-partner insisted that I need to work through this myself rather than take the 'shortcut' of throwing money at it and getting someone else to do it for me. (He's said similar things about \"outsourcing\" the mental work of doing something myself to others in other situations as well. He believes very much that you have to \"work through\" the thing rather than just offload it, in order to Be Better.)\nSo my question to you guys is - what do you think/feel about holding on to relics of the past? It could be things like notebooks from school, old photos, letters, a few clothes that no longer fit (not a whole wardrobe's worth, and the motivation is in preserving the memory rather than thinking I'll actually wear them again). Even things like old files on computers, you know how it is when you get a new computer and have to copy all the files over from folders like 'backup 2 final'.\nMy mom kept all my old school stuff, and passed it on to me a few years ago. I'm not going to get rid of that, mostly because when I was reading it some of the stuff was really funny and/or I remembered it in some way and it was just a blast from the past.\nBut I have been tossing out and deleting stuff from the \"more recent\" past, say from about 10 years ago, that I did go through in a previous purge and decided to keep but now can't think why. Things that were related to me and my ex (long term relationship, 15 years) because although the relationship ended I still had fond memories of that time.\n(As an aside... I lost (in embarrassing circumstances) the memory card from my phone which had the last \"selfies\" my ex and I took of ourselves as he was leaving, as it was sort of a sentimental moment. I felt stupid about that, and vaguely emotional once but then nothing.)\nSometimes I've an urge to \"return to the past\" a bit (seems unusual for an ENTP on the surface (insert \"Is this Si?\" butterfly meme), but I am still sure of my type).\nLast year, for example, I went to a 20 year (has it been that long!) \"Class of 1999\" school reunion. I'd been looking forward to it for a while -- the reunion is held in the school itself, and I was curious to see how much had changed in 10 years (since I went to the 10 year reunion) and also, maybe, to \"re-experience\" some of the good things that went on there. Of course, it had changed a lot, but many of the places were still recognisable although they seemed much smaller than they had at the time (keeping in mind I was 17, not a kid, and pretty much the same physical height and size as I am now at 37).\n\u200b\nTL;DR : how do you guys feel about 'nostalgia'? Do you feel any urge to keep old stuff, to 'return to the past' in some way? Have you tossed things and regretted it later?\n\n"}, {"title": " Avoiding manipulation?

Known each other for 6 yrs. We're colleagues at a university in the college of engineering. I advise students; he's an engineering lab tech. He's currently using his employee tuition waiver benefits to get his master's degree.\nEvent that set things in motion recently: Last Nov. (2019), he and I hung out in his lab office, following an after-hours work mixer. Although we knew each other well enough in a co-worker capacity heretofore, this was the first time that we had uninterrupted time to talk.\nAnd wow, did we talk! We were also a bit tipsy. So I worked with my liquid courage, and admitted I had a crush on him. To which he answered by kissing me, and saying:\n\"What do you think I was trying to do 3 years ago when I invited you out for my 30th birthday?!\" (Summer of 2016)\nI wasn't able to join him back then, so I never found out that's what he was up to!\nAnyways, immediately after that he said in a nerve-wracked, word-vomit fashion:\n\"But...but...but...I can't go past this point, I'm super stressed out and spread thin between work, and getting my master's...and my sister's an asshole who's got 3 kids by 3 different guys, and I'm like their dad...and...and...\"\nI just prematurely reassured him that I was having a great time being in the moment with him, and I that I wasn't asking him for anything. And then we spent the rest of the night either in deep conversation, laughter, or making out till 2am on a work night.\nBUT...of course I want me some more of that sweet, sweet ENTP! He knows that now, and has restated his position of being spread too thin to start something new. He hasn't made any promises; he hasn't said yes, and he hasn't said no. He hasn't told me to wait, but he also hasn't said he's not interested.\nWe've gone out for drinks a couple times since then, and always talked animatedly for hours and end up making out. But we came to the agreement that we could not continue to torture ourselves like that.\nAnd now that we're in quarantine, we've come to the agreement not to text, because it just feels like the virtual equivalent of that torture. \nI'm the one who asked for that boundary when I said: \"If you should want to reach out for me, to open a window of romantic opportunity, I feel open and receptive to you.\"\nHere's some other things he's told me:\n\"I have ALWAYS found you VERY attractive.\" & \"You're hot.\"\n\"I've always thought we've had mutual attraction, chemistry, and banter.\"\n(When I asked him if and what he replays from our interactions):\n\"I recall our kissing is pretty damn synced, so it feels sexy and passionate. I always remember feeling insanely turned on by your body in all aspects. It's hard to hang out platonically, because our attraction is just so raw. Then when you add the mental stimulation, it gets heavy haha.\"\nThe timeline is such that (COVID notwithstanding), he will free up this December 2020, when he finishes his Master's. He will technically have the summer free, and part of me feels like he might slip and reach out then. Who knows?\nTurns out, I would also do well to hold out till the end of year, since I will be studying up a storm for 4+ months from July-Nov. to sit for the Certified Financial Planner exam. (He doesn't know this.)\nI think to myself, will he come back to get me?\n(And no, we didn't have sex...haha)\nEDIT: Thanks for reading, if you got this far.

Lip is a great way of showing an entp development in a \u201cpositive\u201d way, Frank is an example of a very unhealthy entp, ex: Heath ledger as the joker, compare him to frank. Frank manipulates by using others emotions for his personal gain, lip manipulation is used through logic, to help others in a clear \u201cright or wrong\u201d way/ammoral. Lip learns has to balance Fe with Ne and Ti, and that\u2019s when he becomes very balanced with his emotions and \u201clogic\u201d. Frank and Lip= always seen as very similar, but uses their cognitive abilities in different ways. Lip- the best interpretation of an entp I\u2019ve ever seen, surpasses emotions, subliminally caring, has a \u201cangry caring\u201d trait, lip has the saddest story because of the potential he has and it is thrown down the drain due to him not being able to control his FE well in the beginning. Lip clearly does not want to do bitch work his whole life, but when his FE develops, it is able to show him what he truly wants. Example: adopting Xan, taking care of the family, being a mentor/sponsor to people in a rehabilitation process. I don\u2019t believe lip was ever an entp who was meant to go \u201cchange the world\u201d through his brilliance, which is clearly shown. He had a general \u201ccompassion\u201d for doing what he believes if right or wrong. Entp like lip thought process: change the world, in his mind changing the world may not mean anything. Hey \u201cI\u2019m gonna die in 80 years and 200 years later will people even know who I was\u201d probably not. He\u2019s gets more fulfillment out of guiding others because he knows he can very well, the people he is close with is what means the world to him. Helping others reach their full potential= lips entp type, I would call it the \u201cEntp Guardian\u201d, Frank \u201cEntp Anarchist/narcissist\u201d sorry my thought process is all over the place but I mean come on, entp lmao. Anyone else wanna give their interpretation and understanding of what I mean by these subtypes of the entp MBTI type?\nAlso, Fiona=ISFP/isfj\nFiona: goes to lip when it\u2019s a logic based situation, lip can manipulate her thought process by mixing logic and emotion. Example: Fiona talking to lip about going to jail with the Liam cocaine situation, notice how Fiona immediately reacts when Lip says \u201cYou almost killed Liam!!\u201d Mix of logic and emotion, which makes her see his point clearer. After that, Fiona (ISFP/J) follows lip (entp) around like a dog, and agrees with everything he says/let\u2019s him he in control \nFiona with Frank \nFiona: Manipulated by franks emotional manipulation, manipulates fionas emotions for his own personal gain. When she is in an unhealthy state, she does not listen to an ounce of what lip has to say, and goes to frank. The process starts, drinking, drugs, sex, basically Frank\u2019s lifestyle. And she follows him around (again, entp) because she is manipulated into thinking every lifestyle choice he makes is right for her emotions. But she would never listen to an ounce of franks logic, even with all the emotion he manipulates her with \nBasically what I am trying to get at is that and ISFP/J and entp seem to have a relationship, that is literally like brother and sister. It\u2019s a constant competition between them, but special type of caring for each other. Not only is it portrayed in shameless, but I have a friend who is also and ISFP, and it\u2019s almost scary how her and I communicate, just like lip and Fiona do. A very understanding attitude that most other people do not see within those 2 types.\n\n"}, {"title": " I(ISFJ) am so mad at this ENTP right now - Advice needed (self.entp)", "likes": "3", "comments": "31", "content": "This guy I am seeing and I like to have debates (surprise surprise) and it is often about politics. For the sake of my question I'm not going to directly state my views or political party, as that's not the focus of this, and I don't want any comments below to derail into that.\nI'm VERY far leaning on the party I affiliate myself, where this ENTP is more moderate, swinging left and right depending upon the topic.  Despite how passionate I am about my own beliefs I do enjoy listening to the other side and what they say, and try to at least get where they are coming from.  This has lead to long political talks between the ENTP and I even though he know he won't change my mind.  That's fine.\nToday in text he says that he gives anyone with my party affiliation the side eye and that they are the more evil of the two parties. Now hold the phone.  There is a reason Superman and Captain America are widely considered ISFJs - we believe in justice and being good.  I was also shocked he would so casually give me, essentially, a label of 'evil' despite all of our talks. 'Oh, but he didn't say YOU, he said your PARTY.'  My party is in no way perfect but it is an extension of me and he knows that, and essentially, called me evil as a result.  I called him out on that and told him how that insults me, and to speak in absolutes is not fair.  You guys like being called on your bullshit right?  Well, I did that, and asked why he would lump me into something so awful.  Do you consider me to be evil?  A whole hour and a half later I get simply 'no.'  When I asked him to discuss it further he said he doesn't want to right now.\nIf this is the end of us so be it, but what the fuck, man?  Why would someone that will argue anyone into a corner suddenly back down from me when I ask for an explanation on why I am evil?  Is it because the conversation is suddenly feelings based as opposed to logic based?  Did I hurt his feelings?

And it isn't a catch-all rule, but perhaps a normative role. As an archetype, We hate small talk. We hate monotony. We form interesting thoughts before we share them more often than not. This is because before speaking our thoughts, we always give time to form them to an extent, whilst the average extravert might speak thoughts impulsively. And we always are able to communicate these ideals as we haven't any trouble articulating. \nWe can only get the quality of conversation from someone who scrutinizes their own ideals before speaking them. In other words, we only really get to express our labyrinthian thoughts to their truest extent with either an introspective extrovert (which is rare, maybe another entp, or perhaps an enfp, etc.), Or... An introvert.\nWe are not extraverted introverts, as the stereotype of an entp would have you believe. We are extraverts who crave the company of lots of introverts. We want to know lots of people, but only people who themselves do not know lots of people. We can make it just fine at a party, but we're always attracted to the quiet one. The introvert who's friends forced them out. Thus, our favorite party might not the the one swarming and buzzing with interaction, but the one with many circles of different groups, each quietly exchanging ideas amongst themselves. \n(Caveats):\nThis is not to say we don't like the company of other extraverts at all, because clearly many of us we do. And of course, no two people from even the same personality type are the exactly similar. And of course needs to be stressed that every personality type, regardless of stereotypes, is capable of being interesting in conversation. \n(/Caveats)\nBut this I believe to be a common truth: we are the extraverts of the introverts. We thrive on having many friendships and interactions, but the best friendships we have are the introverts. Personally, my favorite type is the infp. There's always some mind-blowing, emotional perspective waiting inside them that flips my whole perception of reality. They're beautiful lmao. \nIn short, tldr, we are extraverts who crave lots of social interaction, but favor that interaction to be with introverts. Extraverts are of course capable of satiating these conversational cravings we have, but we more often than not find our conversational niche for complex, abstract discussion to be fulfilled by introverts. So, we befriend lots of introverts, henceforth, we are the one type known to be an extroverted introvert \nSo yeah, thanks for coming to my Ted talk and all that. Now be another entp and argue with me cause that's why I love y'all lmao. And it's also possible that lots of others have been saying the same thing for a long time, but I felt like sharing my thoughts. \nTldr to a tldr: I'm an extravert ntp who has a thing for introverts and am projecting this on to all of you and that's about it.\n\n"}, {"title": " sometimes Si is a nightmare, sometimes a salvation ...

He implied he didn\u2019t feel as much for me as I probably did for him (taking this from the convo we had the next day). I basically wanted to know if I was wasting my time and he said he doesn\u2019t know and can\u2019t possibly know if I am. I never pushed for a relationship I simply expressed how I felt. I never asked for anything to be honest.\nHe feels guilty that I like him and see something serious while he isnt actually sure. He\u2019s never been in a serious relationship before but has alluded that he wanted to try it with me before.\nHe wanted some space to think about things, I agreed that this was a good idea and we havent spoken for a week, not sure if he will actually reach out.

By knowing how to think, you are limitless in what you can learn. Learning also never stops. It does not stop after school, it does not stop after you get your first job, and it does not stop after you become CEO and king of the world. You need to apply learning in order to truly understand, grow, think creatively, and appreciate any subject. It allows you to be adaptable to all kinds of situations, be unrestrained in your options and pursuits, and find fulfillment in your new adventures. It is a way for you to progress and discover meaning in life. In this sense, learning should be a habit and a never-ending constant, not a means towards an end.\u00a0\nLearning is an universal skill that can be applied to every aspect of life. You can learn art to understand the underlying meaning of a painting to appreciate its beauty. You can learn a language and history to vicariously experience the complexity of another culture. You can learn philosophy to dive into the depth of your inner world. Learning also allows you to excel in any new job or stay ahead of the curve in a new industry. If you are competent in only one skill, then you will only be able to thrive in that niche. If you are competent in learning, you will excel in any subject and expand the horizon of possibilities and paths in your life. Those with poor learning skills will be unable to grasp new subjects, lower their ceiling for potential and growth, limited in their choices in life, and unable to understand and thus appreciate what life has to offer.\u00a0\nKnowing how to learn is like wearing a pair of glasses that gives you perfect vision. It allows you to see your surroundings clearly. You are sure of the colors, shapes, sizes, distances, and functions of the world around you. With perfect eyesight, you know you can walk down a certain path because you can see what lies ahead, you know you can jump over a fence because it\u2019s not that tall, you know not to anger your neighbor\u2019s dog because you saw it biting a stranger, you know you can sail to the island a mile away because you can see how close it is and have seen with your own eyes others do it with ease, and you know a butterfly is reborn after struggling to break out of its chrysalis because you have seen the time lapse of all the stages leading up to its transformation. You are unbound by what you can do and imagine, be able to appreciate new experiences, and understand and piece together all the parts of the world and how it works because you are able to see them clearly. No matter where you venture in life, you will be able to fully soak in the new experience, be aware of your new surroundings, take in the exciting potentials of the new journey, and grow as a person.\nWithout glasses, you will have a poor vision and can not see clearly the world around you. It appears blurry so you are unable to see reality, you can not comprehend what the world looks like, and you have no idea of what is possible. This hinders your imagination of what you can do, your growing knowledge of the world, and the level of fulfillment you get from new experiences. You are afraid to walk down on a pathway because you can not see what lies ahead of you, you are scared to paddle to the island across from you because you could not see how close it is, how calm the sea is, and how easy it is for others to make that journey. You do not dare explore the world outside the comfort of your home. Without glasses, you will be confined to the comforts of your home and afraid to step outside. Even if you were to pursue a new adventure, you will fail to adapt to your new surroundings, expose yourself to danger, be incapable of seeing and understanding your new journey, and thus unable to have any meaningful experience and self growth.\u00a0\nLearning is just like being able to see. If you know how to learn you can then adapt to any situation, experience, and cycles of the world, even if they have never happened before- your potential in life is infinite. Therefore, learning should be a discipline, habit, or virtue, and not a phase. It makes you grow as a person and makes you adaptable to the waves of life. If you know only one skill, you rely on that knowledge to thrive and you are confined to the circle of that niche world. If you know how to learn, then you are able to step outside, pick up new skills, knowledge, perceptions, and expand your circle of possibilities in life. You will be able to adapt and excel no matter what you choose to do, where you choose to go, and no matter the difficulties you face. \nIf you know how to learn and think, you will continuously absorb and grow as a person as you chase after your dreams and your vision of what life should be. Eventually you will completely fill the jar of your life with marbles of beautiful, meaningful, and fulfilling memories and appreciation of the world.\u00a0\n\n"}, {"title": " Making Money as an ENTP (self.entp)", "likes": "10", "comments": "4", "content": "We start out so low, and there's the risk that our Percieving function might never let us be high achievers early on given the unrealistic brilliant plans we make.

However, Fi enables any person to have a very savvy finger on the pulse of how external stimuli can affect their own emotional state.\nMuch like Ti is able to detach pure knowledge for knowledge's own sake from external application of that knowledge, Fi is able to detach pure emotions from the external catalysts for those emotions.\nThe distillation/detachment of emotions from their external catalysts can lead to some pretty cool effects, where an Fi user can use certain stimuli (in the form of thoughts, experiences, surrounding environment, ideas, memories, etc.) to trigger any emotion at will.\nYou can compare this to how Ti can distill/detach ideas from their external application in reality, and they can use certain stimuli (in the form of ideas, axioms, facts, memories, experiences, surrounding environment, etc.) to reach any logical conclusion at will.\nThis is what xxFPs refer to when they talk about \"organic\" or \"inherent\" emotions, which leads to phrases like \"you just gotta FEEL it from within\" or \"tap into the fire within you\", etc.\nThat entire process is simply going through the 'bank' of experiences one has (either past experiences like memories, or present experiences like certain objects in one's surroundings) and linking a set of experiences to an emotional state.\nSo when your FP friend has all these arbitrary demands that seem to make no logical sense such as \"I don't wanna do X, I like Y better\", it probably is because they've figured out that activity Y contains the right combination of catalysts to maximize their enjoyment/productivity/internal emotional stability (whatever the FP friend is looking for at that point in time).\nIt's probably apparent that this process can easily lead to emotional fragility if unchecked, as it's very likely that FPs can spoil themselves by putting themselves in the optimal environment for their emotional state at all times, which leads to a lower tolerance for discomfort.\nPart of Te development in an FP is willingly putting themselves in more uncomfortable situations so they can develop emotional \"callouses\", so to speak, and broaden their range of what's comfortable for them.\n\n"}, {"title": " Have I become a bad ENTP or just boring/depressed?

You have to consider all the planets, their positions, transits, signs, houses, aspects, etc. Basically I've started to find astrology interesting the same way I find some religions interesting; I just love to get more information and knowledge about it even though I don't necessarily believe it myself.\nAlthough I have to admit that the biggest reason I got \"into\" it is that some girl wanted to do my chart last year and I felt genuinely called out. I know how these horoscopes work but still, it was the same kind of feeling I got from MBTI at first; \"how the fuck is this so accurate? maybe I should read a bit more...\". Another funny thing was that she told me she had never seen a chart as \"fucked up\" as mine ever since she got into astrology several years ago. Apparently it was full of contradictions... Surprise.\nAnyway, back to the problem itself. I've been occasionally reading /r/astrology for fun to have a better understanding of the system and it's a constant struggle coz at the same time I want to understand more and I find it genuinely interesting in many ways but also I constantly have this urge to start ranting at people saying stuff like \"well it's just astrology, don't take it so seriously\" lol\nAre there any other xNTPs who've started reading about astrology for fun?\n\n"}, {"title": " Need to let some \u201cfeelings\u201d out - 22F (self.entp)", "likes": "6", "comments": "2", "content": "So I have been romantically involved with this other ENTP male who is six years older than me for over three years. I have had many firsts with him. Many.

I didn\u2019t even know much about MBTI before him and it was so weird that we shared the same dark thoughts and being able to work through them together. I only found out we had the same personality type til months after. I guess I just never felt understood before. I didn\u2019t have to censor myself around him and we grew fond of each other. \nPart of me always knew that this sort of \u201cconnection\u201d (oh god I hate saying that) had grown so strong because of how much we needed each other in a way. The world was full of idiots and we could laugh about it together, and shed the occasional tear while doin it (which is like a rarity to see coming from an ENTP amiright?)\nSo obviously there\u2019s quite an age gap. 6 years. Although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big since he\u2019s a guy and women tend to mature more quickly, he always mentioned that eventually this needed to stop and we tried. We were an on again, off again sorta thing. Never was a full fledge relationship but was something that I could see becoming one in an alternate universe if we were to let it. \nOf course, I was sad whenever we didn\u2019t talk but ya can\u2019t be upset about it forever. I went on dates. Got my heart broke once by this INTP (now lookin back at it, he was a dumbass) and just had fun with being single. Didn\u2019t hook up with anyone since I am not really the type but ya know, going on dates can be fun sometimes. Meeting people is interesting until the person eventually keeps talkin and you realize they\u2019re all just kinda boring. Like, I need my men to have some edge or something Lolol\nAnyways, we took our last break for almost six months and caught up one the phone last week after I texted him at like 4am (i was going thru it lol) and he reached out the next day and it was nice to talk. We caught up and I learned he moved up to San Fran and stuff but the conversation after a while just took a turn. At the end of the day, it just ended up being a talk about how we can\u2019t keep runnin in circles even though all I want is to be friends at this point. Like I feel kinda empty without him. He kinda was my confidante, ya know?\nAnyways, idk why I went on this huge tangent but how do I get over this, fellow ENTPs lol like obviously I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t be rational right now.

I'm not going to get rid of that, mostly because when I was reading it some of the stuff was really funny and/or I remembered it in some way and it was just a blast from the past.\nBut I have been tossing out and deleting stuff from the \"more recent\" past, say from about 10 years ago, that I did go through in a previous purge and decided to keep but now can't think why. Things that were related to me and my ex (long term relationship, 15 years) because although the relationship ended I still had fond memories of that time.\n(As an aside... I lost (in embarrassing circumstances) the memory card from my phone which had the last \"selfies\" my ex and I took of ourselves as he was leaving, as it was sort of a sentimental moment. I felt stupid about that, and vaguely emotional once but then nothing.)\nSometimes I've an urge to \"return to the past\" a bit (seems unusual for an ENTP on the surface (insert \"Is this Si?\" butterfly meme), but I am still sure of my type).\nLast year, for example, I went to a 20 year (has it been that long!) \"Class of 1999\" school reunion. I'd been looking forward to it for a while -- the reunion is held in the school itself, and I was curious to see how much had changed in 10 years (since I went to the 10 year reunion) and also, maybe, to \"re-experience\" some of the good things that went on there. Of course, it had changed a lot, but many of the places were still recognisable although they seemed much smaller than they had at the time (keeping in mind I was 17, not a kid, and pretty much the same physical height and size as I am now at 37).\n\u200b\nTL;DR : how do you guys feel about 'nostalgia'? Do you feel any urge to keep old stuff, to 'return to the past' in some way? Have you tossed things and regretted it later?\n\n"}, {"title": " Behave like ENTP online, awkward as an INTP irl (self.entp)", "likes": "13", "comments": "8", "content": "I've noticed that on Online medias, I do like to socialize and meet new people.

I know I\u2019ll end up rewriting this at some point and add several degrees of accuracy, articulation and nuance, but for now this will do as my first post to this great forum of ideas. Let me know if you can relate.\nSo, I oscillate between 2 main states of being:\n\nIncredibly high levels of passion for new ideas, new surroundings, people (for the potential they represent) and high levels of action in attacking new hobbies and skills. In this condition (my favourite) I feel like there's an infinity of opportunities, I\u2019m attracting very interesting people into my life, I\u2019m stoic, permitting nothing to hinder my inexorable rise and progress towards my lofty goals (yet highly expressive and people feel quite clearly captivated by my charisma, especially romantic partners, or potential ones). I feel an abundance of positive emotions, at the very least above neutral. I am the life of the party, whilst simultaneously feeling grounded and self-assured of my own uniqueness and skills. Exploration, growth and intellectual stimulation are my raisons d'etre.\n\n2)~Until the great pendulum swings the other way...resulting in disinterest in those ideas which had held so much sway in my mind and which, for that brief period had imbued me with so much vitality, passion and purpose. I find that I shift gears, operating at an incredibly low level of output. As I\u2019m disconnected from my emotions, I get frustrated at my lack of drive and willingness to overcome this bout of laziness. I push harder, fruitlessly attempting to infuse some positivity and proactivity into my increasingly rigid corpus. My charisma lessens but being an excellent mimic I can somewhat fake it (while I still care to do so), but I feel exasperatingly impotent - like I\u2019m watching opportunities pass me by through a narrowing pair of binoculars. I turn to escapism, disgusted with myself and the world. Weed has been a major theme in my youth, as have psychedelics (although nearly always safely and responsibly) however these days I prefer to just read (I\u2019m steadily rounding off my sharper edges). I\u2019m always aware of the utter futility of my actions, including the more hedonistic ones - even they fail to instil the perverse anti-authoritarian passion in me that they did in my youth after I\u2019ve reflected on them and decided that they\u2019re rationally pointless (and the novelty has worn out) - I could go on but I think you know where I\u2019m going with all this.\nGenerally-speaking: I crave novelty, I\u2019m promiscuous, yet loyal to whoever makes it through the great-filter and who I deem worthy of extended contact. I\u2019m extremely open minded to all forms of experience (at least until I decide it doesn't add enough value), especially related to the Arts, aesthetic experiences, music, and intellectual activities - oh and whatever gives me a huge burst of adrenaline. I enjoy conversing with experts in their fields, and I've always dated people and made acquaintances with much more mature people than myself, typically a decade or more older. Travel, in a free-form and loose fashion, is the ultimate antidote to my existential angst. I can read for days and regurgitate my thoughts on that or insert references to that material in conversations with interlocutors of all intellectual calibres (always framing it in a relatable way, I\u2019m good at that). I rapid cycle between ideas, hobbies, activities. I have a lot of natural ability at almost everything I try, I'm a fast learner. I could be anything, and yet most of the time I don\u2019t stick to things and choose to be nothing - which frustrates those around me, especially the less-able ones. People view me as a really high-accomplishing, super smart individual; however, I am my own harshest critic and understand that the more I know, probably the further away I am from completion.  Meditation and Yoga help...for a while, but I don\u2019t do them regularly enough for them to become real tools. All in all, life is rather the kaleidoscope of random experiences and I wouldn\u2019t change my personality for the world.\nThoughts?\n\n"}, {"title": "Fuck off automoderator (self.entp)", "likes": "193", "comments": "41", "content": "Every thread I open I have to scroll through your self-righteous bullshit.

There are eight styles and you use all of them, but ENTPs prefer:\n\u2022 Extraversion: \n\u2022 iNtuition\n\u2022 Thinking\n\u2022 Perceiving\nIf your closest personality type is ENTP then you are someone who challenges the status quo, seeking to uncover the hidden potential or new possibilities in different situations. You start projects and introduce change on an experimental basis, not knowing fully what is going to happen, but in the expectation that it will lead to an improvement. You enjoy the challenge of doing something that has not been done before and seems impossible. \nMental Functions:\nThere are two groups of letters in the personality type code:\n\uf0a7 The two letters in the middle (N and T) refer to your preferred mental functions. In total, there are four functions (Sensing, iNtuition, Thinking, and Feeling) that correspond to regions of the brain. You use all of them, but the letters NT indicate which functions you prefer using.\n\uf0a7 The letters on the outside of the code (E and P) indicate which function is dominant in your personality. The letters also describe how you like to use that function.\nThe dominant function of an ENTP is the perceptive one of iNtuition. This means you like looking at information from a global viewpoint, spotting new patterns and relationships, that lead to an understanding of the key issues. You tend to focus more on possibilities for the future than the here-and-now, and you enjoy change, challenge, and variety.\nThe perceptive iNtuition function is extraverted (Ne). That is, iNtuition is used primarily to govern the outer world of actions and spoken words. You therefore try ideas out in practice, to explore new possibilities and discover, by experience, which ones work. You prefer to change procedures to see if any improvement can be made, rather than just operate them. You therefore take an evolutionary approach to development, perhaps with an eye on the strategy which can change. You are more interested in exploring ideas than bringing them to closure.\nMental Function Development \nTo understand the ENTP\u2019s development, we have to understand the hierarchy of mental functions for the ENTP. ENTPs are most comfortable with the Dominant Function Extraverted Intuition and least comfortable with the Inferior Function Introverted Sensing.\nThe timeline for the following steps is not set in stone, an ENTP with directed effort can accelerate the development of the non-dominant functions to achieve GOD TIER faster.\n1 \u2013 Development of Extraverted iNtuition (Ne) \nChildhood \u2013 Puberty: As children, ENTPs will develop the Extraverted Intuition function. They will enjoy fairy tales and may ask their parents to read them stories about fantasy continually. They may also find it hard to be attentive in the classroom, being more interested in the future and their imaginations than in the present. If this function has not been supported for development, they may grow up to be overly stubborn or narrow-minded, not having sufficient insights to make wise conclusions.\n2 \u2013 Development of Introverted Thinking (Ti)\nPuberty \u2013 Age 25: During puberty, the ENTP will start developing the auxiliary function, Introverted Thinking. They will develop a strategic mind and enjoy games and activities that require them to stretch their thinking and imagination like Esports and debate. They will enjoy subjects that combine their capacity for imagination and logical thought like Philosophy & Astronomy. If they have not properly developed this function, they may grow up to be extremely overbearing and stubborn, not willing to listen to the viewpoints of others and to come to conclusions prematurely.\nAreas of Development \nI imagine a large amount of the Reddit community to be currently at this stage developing our secondary function (Ti) before advancing further on the main storyline. Here it is important we farm XP in order to level up before proceeding to the next area. \nAssuming an environment supportive of their development of the dominant and auxiliary functions, most ENTPs would have developed Extraverted Intuition and Introverted Thinking by 25 years old or so. Their areas of improvement will most likely come from the underdeveloped sides of Extraverted Feeling and Introverted Sensing.\nHere are some suggestions for improvement:\n\u2022 Follow through on your projects (Si)\n\u2022 Give encouragement and praise to others for good work (Fe)\n\u2022 Be attentive to detail (Si)\n\u2022 Be more sensitive to the feelings of others (Fe)\n\u2022 Organise your time and your life better (Si) \n3 \u2013 Development of Extraverted Feeling (Fe) \nAge 25 \u2013 Midlife: At the age of 25, the ENTP will feel the tension to continue growing and start developing the tertiary function, Extraverted Feeling. With underdeveloped Fe, ENTPs are very polarising characters, people either think our directness is refreshing or think we are assholes. By working on Fe we can more easily relate to others especially those with a preference for F over T and influence those who were previously put off by the standard ENTP approach. The ENTP can further develop the Extraverted Feeling function through these simple exercises:\n\u2022 Think about the people in your workplace that have aided you or have done good work for you, write a note of thanks and encouragement.\n\u2022 When you get into a debate with someone, consider the other person\u2019s point of view and what is important to him/her. Learn to adjust your stance to find a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\u2022 Ask some of your co-workers out for lunch and get to know them personally. Put all work-related discussions aside and seek to know them as individuals.\n\u2022 Add value to as many others as possible and watch the mental and material rewards come back to you in full. \n4 -Development of Introverted Sensing (Si)\nAt midlife onward, the ENTP\u2019s focus turns toward the inferior function, Introverted Sensing.\nThe underdeveloped Introverted Sensing of the ENTP comes out childishly when they are under stress; they become extremely indulgent in material pleasure or put their focus on unimportant details.\nIn midlife however, there is an unconscious (or conscious if trying to accelerate achievement of GOD TIER) shift and desire to develop that inferior function in order to achieve wholeness and continual growth. It is an uncomfortable but necessary transition.\nHere are some simple exercises to consciously develop the Introverted Sensing function:\n\u2022 When you are given a task, do not jump into it immediately. Instead, break the task down into sequential steps and allocate a certain time to each task before proceeding to execute the task.\n\u2022 Write up tasks you need to complete the night before, do not structure the tasks in terms of time (unless required for work etc.) and tick them off as and when you get bursts of energy throughout the day. \n\u2022 Combine mundane attention to detail tasks with something you enjoy, i.e. listen to podcasts/audio book while doing housework. \n\u2022 Recall a significant event that happened before in your life, recount the details of this event: the sights, sound, smell, touch and taste. Do not try to make connections or consider implications but consider the event as it is.\n\u2022 Master Level: Wake up early every morning (5-6am) and complete the task on your list that is most daunting. This is difficult and you won\u2019t be able to implement it overnight, however, knowing that what needs to be done is already complete allows you to no remove any feelings of guilt associated with taking time for leisure activities.\nFinally, practicing Yoga or Mindfulness is an extremely effective tool to help ground ENTPS in the intricacies of the present, developing Si.\nDevelopmental Side Quests (Optional but Encouraged)\n\nWork out your values as a human being. A set of objective traits or characteristics that you believe to be most valuable in yourself and others, write these down. It is important with any plan or aspiration to make sure it is aligned with your values or you will struggle to maintain long term focus. \nLearn a musical instrument, music is the combination of frequencies and imagination, a perfect opportunity to use both Ne and Ti. There is also a plethora of evidence to suggest that musical competency has marked impact of cognitive function in all stages of life. \nLearn a foreign language. Our interpretation of the world is limited by our linguistics. Learning another language not only provides us with another programming language for interpreting the world but also opens up more connections in the brain (excuse my pseudo-science) further enhancing our Chad ENTP prowess. \nMentor and be mentored. We all have something to learn and something we can give, no matter our age, occupation or education. \n\nI hope this helps, sorry for spelling mistakes, I'm to lazy to correct them. Also this advice is good and I should probably follow it. Have a great day!\n\n"}, {"title": " Your ENTP Care and Handling User Guide and Manual (self.entp)", "likes": "326", "comments": "38", "content": "Congratulations! You\u2019ve come into possession of a rare and often exhausting ENTP unit! Now that you have your very own ENTP here are a few helpful tips and tricks to maximize the fun on their maelstrom of\u2026. stuff\u2026..\nYour ENTP comes with:\n\nFour everyday outfits\nOne extra snazzy suit for special occasions\nOne mobile device for research and communication purposes\nOne laptop for next-level research and communication\nOne gaming console and accessories\nFive complex strategy games\n\nSoftware\nYour ENTP comes pre-programmed with the following traits:\nNe: Your ENTP can generate 45,673 ideas per minute, change subjects at a rate that will make you dizzy, and is always interested in anything and everything. Loves to make comparisons or analogies that make no sense but they will insist it works perfectly. \u00a0\nTi: Your ENTP unit will want to analyze and understand ALL THE THINGS. If interested, will demand as many details as possible. They may process by arguing to see all sides of a situation or idea. Favorite questions are why? And what do you mean?\nFe: Your ENTP has the uncanny ability to pick up on other\u2019s emotions, and will occasionally push to see just how far they can go socially. Low-key cares about people and their opinions\u00a0and doesn\u2019t really like conflict among friends or loved ones (but good luck getting them to admit it).\nSi: As this is their lowest function, your ENTP unit will struggle to keep track of things and lose their keys frequently. Also, makes them prone to buck tradition in favor of doing something novel, but may have strong attachments to certain memories or people.\nGetting Started\n\nPlace your ENTP in front of an open computer with the internet browser open.\nTell them that they can\u2019t accomplish something.\nShow them your favorite meme.\nChallenge them to beat you at your favorite strategy game.\nIf your ENTP unit has not booted up yet, bring 2-3 friends to talk about their nerdy interests or favorite TV shows.\n\nModes\nEccentric Scientist Mode (default): Your ENTP will get very excited by whatever random idea or talent or skill happens to catch their eye and obsessively research it on the internet for a good 2-3 days. Then they will dedicate their life (and a considerable financial investment) to master this project. Within two weeks it will be added to the clutter of abandoned or \u201cIn progress\u201d projects in favor of something new.\nTony Stark (default): Your ENTP will fire up their impressive mental capacities to whirl through countless ideas and possibilities to find the best possible solution for nearly any situation. Be forewarned; just because an idea makes sense to them and they are convinced that it\u2019s amazing, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually foolproof.\nManipulative Bastard: When your ENTP brings their tertiary Fe out to play they can be manipulative little bastards.They are scarily perceptive of what others are feeling and thinking. On the innocent side, they\u2019re sassing you back within hours of meeting you. On the devious side, they know just how to pull your strings to get what they want.\nDetached Robot: Activated when your unit is angry, stressed, or sad. If your ENTP unit refuses to \u201ctalk about it,\u201d complains bitterly that life always sucks, or removes themselves from society to bury in a project, then things are BAD. Resist the urge to push ENTP to open up about it or fix their problems for them. Chances are your unit has already been overthinking the situation and needs a mental escape. To restore to default mode: keep them company and try to redirect their attention to a favorite project or interest. \u00a0\nRelationships with Other Units\nNF: Your ENTP unit will often appreciate the depth and understanding of the NFJ\u2019s and enjoys the random and giggly fun that comes with the NFPs. Caution is advised, however, as NF\u2019s care quite a bit about their feelings and opinions, which your ENTP may find to be boring or muddled.\nNT: \u00a0Relationships with NT types can go one of two ways for your ENTP:. They will either be in mutual delight over how logical and similar the NT\u2019s brain is or your ENTP will reject the NT as useless, arrogant, and not worth tolerating. They can either end up as an awesome power duo or a cold rivalry.\nSJ: Your ENTP will most likely view SJs as useful tools to uphold society, but not good for much else. Your unit will tend to be aggravated by their reliance on tradition or repetition but could stand to learn a thing or two about order and stability.\nSP: This combination is double trouble. Your ENTP secretly admires the SP mastery of their physical environment and will often attempt feats that are beyond their abilities when around SP types, especially XSTP. \u00a0Generally, they get along well\u00a0but don\u2019t leave your unit unsupervised with a group of SPs.\nFeeding\nYour ENTP will forget to eat if not reminded. When left to their own devices, will often skip meals and then wonder later why they are dizzy, grouchy, or exhausted. Feed regularly to ensure they maintain a balanced diet and peak mental efficiency.\nGrooming\nYour ENTP will often put effort into picking out outfits and combinations, only to throw on whatever works for that day and cover the rest with charisma. Remind your ENTP to brush their teeth, shower, and exercise, as they often forget to do so for periods of 2-3 days.\nSleeping\nYour ENTP generally views sleep as a waste of time and do so only when absolutely necessary. \u00a0The preferred sleeping pattern is to stay up through the night and catch up by taking naps throughout the day. ENTP will stubbornly insist that this works (it doesn\u2019t). Send them to bed anyway.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhy do ENTPs like talking with people, even those they aren\u2019t particularly fond of? What do they find in that?\nYour ENTP\u2019s Tertiary Fe enjoys watching people react to things, especially things the ENTP causes. They derive a certain smug pleasure from watching people react predictably (Ti) to purposely offensive, crazy, or outlandish actions or claims. On a less sinister note, your ENTP most likely views pretty much everyone in the world as a potential friend or resource, so they are more than happy to connect and see what happens.\nMy ENTP won\u2019t shut up about season 6 of Battleframe Nebula. What do I do?\nYour ENTP unit is very excited about their newly discovered interest and likely is one of the most knowledgeable persons in existence on the subject. Ask two or three generic questions about their new interest, such as what do you like about [insert name of new interest]? Or ask them to explain it. Above all, do not panic: within two weeks they will have forgotten about Battleframe Nebula.\nMy ENTP has decided that organizing or planning things is a waste of time. How do I fix it??\nYour ENTP unit has most likely decided that things will work just fine if they go with the flow. Your unit has a preference for keeping their calendar in their head, which is subject to constant change. Point out to your unit that a keeping a written schedule helps them see where they are budgeting their time and helps others know when the ENTP will be available for socializing.\nsource\n\n"}, {"title": " Just a feel good love letter to all the ENTPs (self.entp)", "likes": "245", "comments": "57", "content": "From an INFP who fell in love with one of you guys, you ENTPs are the most genuine, fascinating brains I have ever met, the way your thoughts jump around at erratic and lightning speeds, bouncing from A to D to B, C, X, Y and back to A, it gives me mental whiplash to try and keep up with you.

Their argument is normally a list of reasons my argument is wrong but they are never able to accurately describe, in depth, why they think a certain thing without using (usually unrelated) criteria. it is always an offensive justification of me being wrong instead of a defensive statement about what they actually think:\nit goes like this:\nentp: i don\u2019t agree with this criteria\nintj: the criteria is right\nentp: why do you say that?\nintj: because your point is wrong because it doesn\u2019t align with the criteria \nyea no shit? it\u2019s a completely circular and nonsensical argument. like...what?\nStep 2: \u201cI Just Know You\u2019re Wrong, Trust Me, My Ni Says I\u2019m A Savant\u201d\nwhen i push them to give an individual argument as to why my argument is wrong, i am either met with a Fi dismissive, sensative attitude (at this point the conversation is a total goner). or i\u2019m met with some complete and utter Ni bullshit. i know that everybody likes to pretend Ni isn\u2019t the most absolute bullshit, egotistical, and frustrating function- but it is. it\u2019s cute sometimes but when that Ni canon is firing at you i swear to god, the only answer is to run and hide. don\u2019t get me wrong, all these NiDoms have the right to their opinions just like everybody else, but you don\u2019t get to tell me i\u2019m wrong and then refuse to tell me why and hit me with that \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is, i just know it, i understand how it works but i can\u2019t explain\u201d. and then go all Fi on me when i won\u2019t validate your Ni-prophetic assertions about why i am a complete dipshit. \nStep 3: \u201cIf I\u2019m Right, You Can\u2019t Be Right, So Shut Up\u201d\nnever expect them to validate your points. if it doesn\u2019t fit their big picture it\u2019s all wrong. \u201ci see what you\u2019re saying but it doesn\u2019t match my opinion so it\u2019s wrong.\u201d i often tell people in arguments when i agree with smaller points they make even if i don\u2019t agree with their entire argument. if they present a logical idea i will validate it. NiTe NEVER does this and will never be thankful for your smaller validations of their ideas because they want to win. and if they can\u2019t win they will emotionally or intellectually tap out.\ni see so many Ni doms on reddit and in real life say that they like to explore ideas from multiples angles which is completely delusional. that\u2019s Ne not Ni....they will explore the implementation (NiTe) or the motivation (NiFe) behind ideas like nobody\u2019s business but once Ni says \u201cjump\u201d they say \u201chow high?\u201d. and NiTe says \u201chow high exactly? what do i do after i land? everybody who doesn\u2019t jump exactly like me is wrong, let me give them you unsolicited advice about how to jump like me.\u201d and if you ask them why why they are jumping they wont answer and will tell you that you\u2019re wrong for not jumping too. \nStep 4: If You Don\u2019t Agree With Me, You\u2019re An Oppressor and A Retard \nat this point in the conversation, i feel like i\u2019m going totally fucking bananas! it\u2019s either completely dissolved into Ni-horseshit or it\u2019s Te hitting me over the head with facts that DONT MATTER, or its Fi shutting down like a child and thinking i\u2019m a bully for asking you to prove why you say that i am wrong? and then they say they\u2019re worn out or change the subject but will never ever admit to being wrong. ever. \nexcuse my rant & typos and shit, i\u2019m just so peeved, \ni have been in several personal and  in-class discussions with INTJ friends lately and i swear to god it\u2019s not worth it. its not worth the trouble. do not engage. walk away slowly. never look back. \ni find working with intjs to be such a wonderful fluid experience. but disagreeing with them might be worst than any of the other types.\n\n  it\u2019s not entirely illogical Fi stuff which tickles my Fe into just giving them a hug and realizing i don\u2019t care lol. \n  it\u2019s not a fact/practicality based argument (Si, Se, Te) which is honestly refreshing at times. \n  it\u2019s not a Ti analysis of my Ti analysis which is always lovely. \n-it\u2019s not another Ne expanding my argument and making me forget my entire point \n  and its certainly not a criticism of my point from a more broadly empathic lens (Fe)\n\nit\u2019s a shitshow combo of all my weeknesses, uses poorly, against me. which is...so bad. \n\n"}, {"title": " movie which shows how to recognize artificial breasts ..

As time went on, the internet's utility towards certain areas (ahem porn) encouraged rapid development, and it became a platform for not only tech geeks and the lonely, but for everyone. This was only further reinforced by technologies allowing access to the internet away from home, work, or school. Anyone on reddit can attest to the overwhelming influence the internet has on not just individuals but society, and how 24/7 access to nearly unlimited information has completely changed the playing field for how we move through the world.\nNow that the internet has completely taken off and is a fundamental part of developed society, what do you think will be the next big invention / advancement that will set developed society on its ear?\nMy personal take? I think the farther we go into replicating the reproductive process and being able to interfere with the \"natural\" (natural here not being good or bad, just meaning minimum interference of medicine) way of reproducing, we're going to see a major shift in society's mentality towards reproduction. I'm getting at the growing possibility of artificial wombs, being able to restructure eggs and sperm into functional zygotes, and/or things like CRISPR being able to modify zygotes towards genetic optimization.\nTL;DR: The internet (and associated technologies) radically changed life as we knew it. What big advancement do you think will have similar effects? Do you agree/disagree with my assessment? Why or why not?\n\n"}, {"title": "Yo, any tips on how to read?

One side of me wouldn't trade it for the world and the other side wishes I could wake up tomorrow as an ISxJ. \nWe don't make up a large part of the population, and thank goodness! Can you imagine if more people were like us Anyway, I've been alive for 29 years so I figured I would post some useful information about what I've learned so far from being an ENTP. \nMost People Will Not Get You\nOur Ne makes us super creative! It can come up with endless angles and possibilities. \nENTPs corner the market when it comes to sheer imagination and creativity. I don't think we ever fully \"grow up.\" We can literally look at a blank piece of paper and create a scene or idea from it. \nHere's the problem. Most people will not appreciate your endless supply of ideas. \nThis includes other intuitives as well. It overwhelms them. \nThey get annoyed or pissed off. We live in the world of possibilities so jumping from one thought to the next, one idea to the next, is great for us. But, others don't see it like we do. \nI think many ENTPs try to impress people with their wits and ideas and end up doing the opposite.\nAt worst, smart ENTPs can come off as crackpots. \nMost people think we're smart but somewhat neurotic. \nThe few that become millionaires or wealthy are labeled as \"Visionaries.\"\nSolution: \nDiscuss, debate and talk about half the ideas you come up with. Be selective! When around people, use your Ne to come up with quirky and funny observations that make people laugh. Think of Chandler Bing on Friends. He's an ENTP. Save your ideas for people who can handle them (not many) or when it matters. \nNo Middle Ground, We Win Big or Lose Big\nENTPs not balanced by nature. I would say that we are the ultimate gamblers in life. \nOur natural inclination is to go completely all in when we're interested in something. \nI was looking at average incomes for all 16 personalities and was surprised that ENTPs were the 2rd from the bottom. \nOnly INFPs made less. I was thinking \"what the hell, I thought we were supposed to be smart!\"\nAt first, I thought the stats were wrong. \"Someone messed up on the numbers, \" or \"the test base was flawed,\" I reasoned. \nBut then, the answer hit me like a lightbulb! We win big and lose big. \nIn other words, either we harness our Ne to become successful or we waste it. Circumstances and luck have a slight role to play in it as well. If there were, theoretically, 100 ENTPs in the USA, then 10-15 of them would be massively rich and the other 85 will be broke. \nWhat's more, and this comes with personal experience, we leave things right before they come to fruition or afterwards when we get bored. \nSo sometimes we are on the cusp of hitting the \"jackpot\" but leave right before it's going to pay out. Or, we're successful at being a dairy farmer and then take everything we have and invest it in orange juice commodities :O\nSolution: \nIn baseball, we all want to see home runs but its base hits and pitching that wins games. It's in our nature to try to hit the home run. We live for that. Being average is not in the books for most of us. We're creative and we want everyone to know it. The only way this can be arguably measured is by making lots of money. So we want to always win big. I've learned to try to make a dollar first before trying to make a million dollars. \nNote: I have a successful internet marketing and web design business but I have lost tens of thousands and time going after risky deals, options and poorly thought out business ideas. \nUse Fe To Interact With Most People\nThis is big! I also learned this the hard way. Do not use Ne and Ti to interact with most people. Yeah, a few people will think you're amazing, but you'll lose more people than win. \nDevelop your Extroverted Feeling (3rd function) by watching, befriending or interacting with ENFJs or ESFJs. They will teach you a lot. Fe gives you the biggest net when it comes to people. \nIt will help you make friends, be liked and SELL your ideas. You might have the best idea but your Extroverted Feeling will help you get people excited about it. \nUsing Ne + Ti to interact with people is fun for you but it's like fishing with a pole. \nYou'll catch some fish here and there. \nUsing Fe is like finishing with large commercial nets. You'll catch 1000s of fish. They're jump right into the boat!\nFe allows you to win people over and once you do that, then you can slowly introduce your Ne. \nExample: Oprah and Will Smith. Everyone loves them. I am 100% sure that Oprah is an ENFJ and 60% sure that Will Smith is. Are those people amazingly smart. No. But, everyone loves them. ENFJS are the best at talking about other people's ideas, other people's talents and pumping them up. They can cheat through life, without ever knowing anything (not implying at all they are dumb) because they can \"piggyback\" off smarter people than them. \nSupercharge your Fe to the best of your ability. The best way to do this is to see Fe dom people in action. I become friends with a guy named Reed 5-6 years ago and that's when my Fe took off. I didn't know anything about MBTI or functions at the time but I was amazed how he effortlessly made friends. I don't think he had one enemy besides other guys who were jealous of him. \nI studied his patterns, how he talked to people and thought process and do my best to duplicate it. When I make a conscience effort to do it, I get the desired results most of the time. \nPlan of Action: \nYou have Fe in you but its not well developed. Don't wait to develop it later in life. Do it now. You can get to point A to Z faster with it. You'll be able to have a bigger network, which will assist you with what you really want to accomplish. If you want to be successful, then you will need people. Lots of them. Fe allows you make friends with whoever you need to, in the shortest amount of time possible.. \nRelationships Will Be Hard For You\nThe combination Ne + Ti will make you relationship challenged. Accept it. That combo produces traits that are not naturally good for long term relationships,.\nAgain, this is where your Fe comes in. You'll be able to attract the most amount of men and women with it.\nThe problem is that you'll get bored from using this function too much. ENTPs can be sweet and personable at first but after a while the dominate traits will manifest themselves. You might have held your tongue with your girlfriend during the first three months of the relationship but sooner or later she will see the \"real side.\"\nAlso, I am tired of websites saying that INTJs and INFJs are the best match for us. I think that is bullsh*t. \nWe make decent work partners with them but in life the Ne vs Ni has major complications. Be aware of it. Ne + Ni is not the Cinderella pairing that people make it out to be. \nI'm not saying both types cannot work with us but don't think that those two personalities are your natural soul mates either. \nINTJ:\nMany INTJs get annoyed very quickly with ENTPs. I love them and have several as friends but I stopped talking about my ideas with them a long time ago. They have one singular focus in life, are not fun to debate with and take life way more serious than you do. While you are just thinking your thoughts out loud, they are thinking what an idiot you are because you have not researched your facts. They only talk about things they know 100%. \nHowever, they are loyal, insanely smart, don't beat around the bush and if you can get past their strong outer shell (keep trying even when you get nowhere the first couple times), it can work. But don't go into it with \"rose colored glasses.\"\nINFJ\nThis match it better than the INTJ for relationships because at least we share two functions. A big plus about INFJs is that they are actually pretty darn logical though has aux Fe. \nINFJs will blow your mind by their insights on things. Again, all N functions are not created equal and Ni and Ne do completely different things. They will be annoyed by your Ne if you use it too much. They will try to understand you with their aux Fe but that first Ni function is so powerful, it might make things very challenging. They don't bounce around and like long term goal setting, even if they never do it. \nAlso, they have a hard time with action. Like INTJs, they are insanely smart and will usually have a long term plan. However, they have a very hard time implementing the plan. If your two overall goals line up then its a go. They will make the plan and you will make it happen. \nBut if they do not, forget about it. They will be super passionate about this one thing in life and your mind will be everywhere, and trust me, from experience, after a while it gets tiresome. \nYou'll be trying to motivate her/him to do something but Ni can rarely be persuaded to do anything unless they think of it themselves. \nSolution: \nThere is no hard solution for this one. Each one will have to approach this landfill the best they can. Despite what Kiersey and other books say, I personally think SJs are the best for ENTPs. They're loyal, with do all the 101 small things you forgot to do but need to do (like wash your clothes and file your taxes) and love your \"go getter\" attitude more than they hate your \"impulsivity.\" Surprisingly, I have seen many ENTPs have good relationships and marriages with ISFJs. SJs have tertiary or inferior Ne. They want to be more spontaneous, want to do new things but just don't know how. If you can be just a little more \"stable\" than you otherwise would, they work out better than people give them credit for. \nKnow Your Role In Society \nIt's no coincidence that the population is unevenly distributed among the 16 types.\nMost of the world are SJs or SPs. They make up the largest percentage of the population. They hold the entire world together. SJs do things in a more regimented way and SPs do things in a light-hearted, fun way, but they both accomplish the same thing. Think of them as the foundation or glue for Earth. \nNFs make the world a less cruel and more compassionate place. Without them, we would have blown ourselves up decades ago. \nNTs are responsible for creating things. They move technology forward. Most of our gadgets can be attributed to some NT coming up with it. \nMy point: NTs are rare for a reason: our world doesn't need too many of us. We need just enough of them to invent new things (Ne) or improve upon the things we already have (Ni).\nENTPs are made to create. Your whole function stack is made to come up with new ideas that nobody else is thinking about. \nIf you are in a profession or job that is not doing that, it's time to change. You will never be happy with your career or life if you are not doing what you were born to do. \nYou will never find a happy ENTP as an accountant or brick layer (you can make a lot of money at those jobs btw, so its not about the money). You need to engage yourself in jobs that utilize your Ne + Ti. Period.\nCreate. Invent. Explore. Just know that your talent is not easily translatable to the general population. You're an Extrovert but for all practical purposes, a lone wolf. Develop your people skills to interact better with the mundane physical world while at the same time working on generating unique possibilities that will set you ahead of everyone else in life. \nNe can be your best friend or worst enemy. Be aware of it and don't get butt-hurt when people don't get you. Oh course not! You are talking about things that don't exist in their mind. You can see it, plain as day, but they can't. \nHowever, when you become an instant millionaire some day, everyone will wonder in amazement how you did it. They just thought you were an funny yet average guy. Then, you can tell your story. Then you can unleash your complete Ne + Ti and everyone will call you a genius. People will wish they had your talents. \nOkay, I am done rambling. Looking forward to people telling me what they think.\nLink\n\n"}]]}
