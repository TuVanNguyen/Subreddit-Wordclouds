Please share your insights.  I've listed a few of mine.\n\nStay reserved.  People already are intimidated by you, when you argue with someone it will crush them.  Use silence and body language more often than words.\nFocus on one goal that matters most to you and let that be the basis of everything you do, never forget the main goal and see how everyone fits into that one goal.\nRead as much as possible to equip yourself with knowledge and strategy.  Especially The Art of War by Sun Tzu.\nWhen you interact with people, realize that everyone has a skill and admire that skill when you speak with them.\nStay sober, you have way too much confidence and have no problems being sociable and you're too focused on goals to be distracted by drugs or alcohol.\nHit the gym everyday.\nMeditate on the goal you want to achieve and envision it coming true.  Usually I do it throughout the day, but it's most effective when I dedicate time towards it.  There is always an answer to a question after these meditations but I can never seem to put into words the question or the answer, it's abstract.\nSpend time in nature to fulfill some emotional need that we lack from human interaction.  Again this one seems like a waste of time before getting there, but once you're there you understand there is some part of you that is missing, the Sensing or Feeling side and nature takes care of that pretty well.  Especially basking in sunlight.\nSometimes doing nothing and/or walking away is the best move.  \"If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.\" - Sun Tzu from The Art of War.\nTo-do lists are your bread and butter.  Check them off on the reg.\nMinimize, simplify, and consolidate as much as possible.  You have lofty goals and not enough time.  It's as simple as deleting phone numbers, downsizing your wardrobe, getting rid of unnecessary monthly subscriptions.\nDelegate often.  We are tempted to micromanage everything (because we're so god damn efficient) however your employees will hate you for it and this will cause disturbance in the harmony of the team, which will effect the bottom line and the quality of the product or service.\nMaster learning the other MTBIs in order to recruit the right team players and communicate more effectively.  Also can be used to help others achieve their goals.\nUse your NT to hone in on indicators of emotions because you obviously cannot feel them as much as others.  But to get by and not come off as some cold blooded ruthless asshole, you can learn to react and set someone at ease by using logic.  Making people feel good helps you in the end and you gain more support to further your cause.\nGood work needs to be inspired, encouraged, and nurtured.  It doesn't hurt but actually helps saying \"Thank you\" or \"Good Job\" just a bit more often.\nThe last and ultimate one is to accept that it is lonely at the top.  Realize that YOU are your own audience.  Live on your own terms and move your cause forward.\n\n\n"}, {"title": "A poetic description of ENTJ (self.entj)", "likes": 0, "comments": "2", "content": "You are a screaming crowd, the rush of adrenaline pushing you further.

Not being completely fine at the moment is rather understandable. Even with this in mind, I can't help but being worried by the change I witness everyday in my ENTJ boyfriend since we have been in lockdown (we live together). \nIn normal conditions, he would wake up fairly early in the morning, go to the gym, go to work, have a lot of interactions, and get home generally satisfied with his day. Of course, now the routine is pretty different for all of us, me included. Though, it looks particularly different for him: he never wakes up before 10 (or even 11), and most days he does not exercise nor get some work done, at all. I'll specify he does look happy on a surface level: he laughs with me, intimacy is great, we do activities together (cooking, watching something, etc.) - but I keep sensing he's stressed deep inside for his unproductiveness, and does not want to show nor to cope with this sentiment. \nSometimes he would give out clues. \"Ah, today I tried to get some work done, but I found a bug in my code and got demotivated quickly\", or, \"I'm lucky you are with me in this period, or I wouldn't have any structure at all in my day\" -- which does not sound like him at all: normally he's so busy during the day that we would hardly find time to interact. I would argue he has always been the one with the most solid structure among us two. Also, I have a dear ENTJ friend as well, and while he now does complain about the lack of social interactions, he never lost his productivity at work. This may bias me, of course, but it somehow tells me that an ENTJ would not lose his grip on his goals even during such a quarantine.  \nAnyway, my boyfriend avoids talking about these things on a deeper level, and may even look upset if I try to address the topics (thus, I stopped doing that).\nSo, I am looking for your advice now: \n1) Am I overthinking all this? Being an INFJ, I may easily assume things about his feelings. I would prefer to hear that there is not need for me to worry, and in this case we can ignore point 2 and 3.\n2) If I have indeed reasons to be worried: should I try to help him, or should I let him figuring things out by himself? I trust his capacities a lot, so this may be a viable option.\n3) If I should try to help him: ...how? Maybe help is not even the right term here; I would at least like to support him as best as I can.  \nExcuse me for the wall of text. I hope you are all doing well.\n\n"}, {"title": "Entj memes are so damn funny (self.entj)", "likes": "16", "comments": "3", "content": "That's all\n\n"}, {"title": "Did you have trouble deciding on your career?

I've been thinking of making videos geared towards thinking about reality differently, dividing the self into thoughts, sensory experiences, and emotions, and giving very brief 3 minute videos explaining summarized and researched self-help techniques through these 3 divisions, but framed through a sort of sci-fi reality-bending storyline.\nIn terms of how to make profit, I was thinking of making free e-books that are 10-pages long and then three short 30-100 ebooks to be sold.

I am a young individual and as you know, the more you ask, the better you learn.\nMy mother is an ENTJ, and... I usually feel overwhelmed when I have to speak myself. No no no, don't get me wrong. I think she is a very nice and kind person but... She doesn't know how to... Express her feelings and every time someone from work made her feel bad, she goes out of her way to interrupt me and inflict great deal of damage on my morale because she doesn't know what her words feel like.\nI am an INFJ and I don't really talk much but I think deeply about things. I hate nobody and I love everyone. I believe there aren't bad people. Just people who are misunderstood. I am one to always try to help when someone is feeling bad, reacting emotionally or rationally, depending on the case. I really like thinking when I am on my own. I enjoy reading things like what Plato said. I like to think on oblivious things, ones that are dark and thoughtful.\nI am 18 years old (well, almost) and I want to explore every personality type, because I want to make myself a business in the future. I want to know how to talk to everyone. I want to be the good guy who can be \"perfect\" (if that's how you call it). I just want to know how to talk to my colleagues and I will treat them as equals. I don't like hierarchy and abusing power over others. I want to be the type of person who helps everyone with any of their struggles - emotional or not. I want the office to feel like a big family of 1000 people. I just need to know what to do to achieve it. I get tired after very long conversations, though. My mother can lead long conversations on end without being tired at all.\nIn conclusion I want to say I love my mother and I think she is a very brave person. She needs more attention than what I can provide and it takes more than 5 hours of talking to get to her emotions and help her stop holding grudges. How can I help her faster and... Without risking too much of hurting myself in the process?\n\n"}, {"title": " What's the worst thing one can do to entj?

But at the same time, I do also only prefer to surround myself with those who are on the page as me career/personal growth wise.\nEverything on ENTJ description is 100% spot on to me, and my girlfriend was just laughing so much at how she could think I was an ENFP. The ENTJ that doesn't resonate with me is the \"strict\" rational/logic thinking, and heavy organization.

At home its my INFJ who's nagging me to get on the dishes and take the dogs out all day.\n\nI had never really dug into ENTJ before, but as I read it (on the 16 personalities website) a lot of it resonates with me, however ENTJ is painted as basically \"The brash asshole\" and I feel I have more emotion and empathy towards others than that. However after reading the typing to my INFJ girlfriend, and then reading through a ton of ENTJ/INFJ relationship posts online, she gave me a 100% without a doubt I am an ENTJ, so now I am confused on which one I am!\nOn the ENFP side, as you can see I like to use words like \"I feel\", when speaking.

I have an intense ambition in the workplace, and have no issue with firing people (I call it, letting people realize they've fired themselves), or with having difficult conversations. I feel the emotions in my gut around a difficult conversation I have looming with an employee, but it's never stopped me or altered the conversation I had planned. I really resonated with ENTJ identifying processes and making them more efficient, coaching and improving those around me and that's one of my standout features in my corporate success thus far.\nMy girlfriend (Long time girlfriend, we have kids, just aren't into marriage) after reading her the ENTJ, and ENFP blind, chose ENTJ on every single category. I even asked her if I was more like Steve Jobs, or ellen degeres, will smith or gordon ramsey etc.. and she chose the ENTJ celebrities. I also admit I resonate with them more too, but I am struggling with the fact that I am not empathetic, and an asshole.\nThe only other holdup is that I have to work for time management and routines. It is not a natural process for me like it should be with an ENTJ, however that is also a thing with ADHD. To be clear, I am obsessed with time management, and workplace productivity/organization. Almost obsessed with it, but it's something I can't do naturally, as I get sidetracked easily. I am big picture oriented, but also obsessive about the details. Thanks for staying with me this long if you have. I resonate with certain things on ENFP, but when it comes to the workplace, and parenting in particular, I am 0% ENFP, and 100% ENTJ according to all the descriptions and research I've done on it.\nTLDR: Read the bullet points above and determine if I'm an ENFP, or ENTJ with ADHD.\n\n"}, {"title": "How do you trust your gut feeling?

By knowing how to think, you are limitless in what you can learn. Learning also never stops. It does not stop after school, it does not stop after you get your first job, and it does not stop after you become CEO and king of the world. You need to apply learning in order to truly understand, grow, think creatively, and appreciate any subject. It allows you to be adaptable to all kinds of situations, be unrestrained in your options and pursuits, and find fulfillment in your new adventures. It is a way for you to progress and discover meaning in life. In this sense, learning should be a habit and a never-ending constant, not a means towards an end.\u00a0\nLearning is an universal skill that can be applied to every aspect of life. You can learn art to understand the underlying meaning of a painting to appreciate its beauty. You can learn a language and history to vicariously experience the complexity of another culture. You can learn philosophy to dive into the depth of your inner world. Learning also allows you to excel in any new job or stay ahead of the curve in a new industry. If you are competent in only one skill, then you will only be able to thrive in that niche. If you are competent in learning, you will excel in any subject and expand the horizon of possibilities and paths in your life. Those with poor learning skills will be unable to grasp new subjects, lower their ceiling for potential and growth, limited in their choices in life, and unable to understand and thus appreciate what life has to offer.\u00a0\nKnowing how to learn is like wearing a pair of glasses that gives you perfect vision. It allows you to see your surroundings clearly. You are sure of the colors, shapes, sizes, distances, and functions of the world around you. With perfect eyesight, you know you can walk down a certain path because you can see what lies ahead, you know you can jump over a fence because it\u2019s not that tall, you know not to anger your neighbor\u2019s dog because you saw it biting a stranger, you know you can sail to the island a mile away because you can see how close it is and have seen with your own eyes others do it with ease, and you know a butterfly is reborn after struggling to break out of its chrysalis because you have seen the time lapse of all the stages leading up to its transformation. You are unbound by what you can do and imagine, be able to appreciate new experiences, and understand and piece together all the parts of the world and how it works because you are able to see them clearly. No matter where you venture in life, you will be able to fully soak in the new experience, be aware of your new surroundings, take in the exciting potentials of the new journey, and grow as a person.\nWithout glasses, you will have a poor vision and can not see clearly the world around you. It appears blurry so you are unable to see reality, you can not comprehend what the world looks like, and you have no idea of what is possible. This hinders your imagination of what you can do, your growing knowledge of the world, and the level of fulfillment you get from new experiences. You are afraid to walk down on a pathway because you can not see what lies ahead of you, you are scared to paddle to the island across from you because you could not see how close it is, how calm the sea is, and how easy it is for others to make that journey. You do not dare explore the world outside the comfort of your home. Without glasses, you will be confined to the comforts of your home and afraid to step outside. Even if you were to pursue a new adventure, you will fail to adapt to your new surroundings, expose yourself to danger, be incapable of seeing and understanding your new journey, and thus unable to have any meaningful experience and self growth.\u00a0\nLearning is just like being able to see. If you know how to learn you can then adapt to any situation, experience, and cycles of the world, even if they have never happened before- your potential in life is infinite. Therefore, learning should be a discipline, habit, or virtue, and not a phase. It makes you grow as a person and makes you adaptable to the waves of life. If you know only one skill, you rely on that knowledge to thrive and you are confined to the circle of that niche world. If you know how to learn, then you are able to step outside, pick up new skills, knowledge, perceptions, and expand your circle of possibilities in life. You will be able to adapt and excel no matter what you choose to do, where you choose to go, and no matter the difficulties you face. \nIf you know how to learn and think, you will continuously absorb and grow as a person as you chase after your dreams and your vision of what life should be. Eventually you will completely fill the jar of your life with marbles of beautiful, meaningful, and fulfilling memories and appreciation of the world.\u00a0\n\n"}, {"title": "That was unexpected (self.entj)", "likes": "6", "comments": "8", "content": "I am back on Reddit after an extended vacation.

However, Fi enables any person to have a very savvy finger on the pulse of how external stimuli can affect their own emotional state.\nMuch like Ti is able to detach pure knowledge for knowledge's own sake from external application of that knowledge, Fi is able to detach pure  emotions from the external catalysts for those emotions.\nThe distillation/detachment of emotions from their external catalysts can lead to some pretty cool effects, where an Fi user can use certain  stimuli (in the form of thoughts, experiences, surrounding environment, ideas, memories, etc.) to trigger any emotion at will.\nYou can compare this to how Ti can distill/detach ideas from their external  application in reality, and they can use certain stimuli (in the form  of ideas, axioms, facts, memories, experiences, surrounding environment,  etc.) to reach any logical conclusion at will.\nThis is what xxFPs refer to when they talk about \"organic\" or \"inherent\" emotions, which leads to phrases like \"you just gotta FEEL it from  within\" or \"tap into the fire within you\", etc.\nThat entire process is simply going through the 'bank' of experiences one  has (either past experiences like memories, or present experiences like  certain objects in one's surroundings) and linking a set of experiences  to an emotional state.\nSo when your FP friend has all these arbitrary demands that seem to make no  logical sense such as \"I don't wanna do X, I like Y better\", it probably is because they've figured out that activity Y contains the right  combination of catalysts to maximize their  enjoyment/productivity/internal emotional stability (whatever the FP  friend is looking for at that point in time).\nIt's probably apparent that this process can easily lead to emotional  fragility if unchecked, as it's very likely that FPs can spoil themselves by putting themselves in the optimal environment for their emotional state at all times, which leads to a lower tolerance for discomfort.\nPart of Te development in an FP is willingly putting themselves in more uncomfortable  situations so they can develop emotional \"callouses\", so to speak, and broaden their range of what's comfortable for them. \nOn the flip side of this, Te Doms' calices are so strong, and they've expanded their range of comfort so wide, that they don't have enough of a way to distinguish what affects their emotional state from what doesn't, because in making every experience \"bearable\" or \"comfortable\", they don't know how to differentiate more comfortable situations from less comfortable situations (until after the fact).\n\n"}, {"title": "ENTJ Programmers (self.entj)", "likes": "29", "comments": "59", "content": "Hey there to all my fellow brethren.

Just like goals, intelligence has a watershed moment. It's like an 'achievement unlocked', where you get access to a skill within that subject matter. And that is what my ramble is about today, how intelligence can be improved.   \nIntelligence can be increased through persistence and exposure to an idea until you hit a threshold. Being exposed to a certain idea helps you deduce and formulate a pattern on the subject matter. From there your intuition can function on autopilot even when you're not consciously thinking about the subject matter. Because the subconscious mind is able to detect patterns through exposure from the conscious mind. These patterns help you to think a certain way about the subject in ways other people are not able to see. Exposure and time is what builds your intelligence in the backburner. \nThere is no memory or retentive faculty based on lasting impression. What we designate as memory is but increased responsiveness to repeated stimuli. - Nikola Tesla. \n\u200b\n https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/16/5/609/276885 \nThis is why persistence is important when trying to achieve a goal. Persistence allows you to gain intelligence in the background. The longer you stick with a subject matter the more intelligent you become. I would like to clarify that I am not talking about wisdom. I'm talking about the creative and inventive faculties of the mind. Experience can help you become pseudo-intelligent and prevent you from making mistakes, but creative intelligence helps you become a forward thinker and design new pathways in uncharted territories. How the subject relates to world and nature, or how it can be manipulated in order to serve mankind and commercialize it to the masses. Time and exposure is what it takes to be able to get your mind to learn how to think.   \nTL:DR; Stick to a subject matter that you have interest in and get smarter.\n-Steve Dobbs rambling\n\n"}, {"title": "Do you ever need to \u201cdo it in the moment\u201d (self.entj)", "likes": "62", "comments": "20", "content": "Like cleaning for example.

Right now we are home officed but I think the day we have to go back to the actual office marks the day of my resignation.\nMost of my day work consists of copy and pasting data from documents into an excel document. This morning I had to copy and paste 100 files.... There is the occasional E-Mail to write. That's basically it and there is not a lot of room for more responsible tasks (because there are none).  I have to fulfill everything to my superiors minuscule requirements. They don't take any suggestions and I don't blame them as I am the new kid, why would they listen to me? \nMaybe I am being a pussy. I still get paid during a time where many people don't due to a black swan event. Seems like a first world problem and most people don't like what they are doing on a day to day basis. I don't want to be \"most people\", though.\nI have already developed some business ideas and a possible source of income for the time my own business won't provide any money. I feel like this is the path I am destined for, building great products, starting new ventures. When I listened to how people like Kevin O'Leary could not work for someone else, I feel exactly that. Much in the 8w7 way I feel like my own life is taken away by my job, I am not in control and I can't do what I like and what I am good at.\nI feel like all the unfulfilled potential, all the unbound ENTJ energy is being laid in shackles with every stupid, time-consuming meeting and every mundane task. This feels wrong with every fibre of my body. Money is the only reason to keep going but I am not someone who spends big on consumption.\nMy plan is to collect 1 or 2 more paychecks and then ride my unicorn into the sunset. I will have enough savings to \"fail\" for a few years and I am still young. What do you think?\nAs you can see in my history I also had the experience of seeing my father die quite suddenly. This has shown my, like nothing else before, that life is extremely short and can be taken away from you at any time in a blink. And there are limits to what parts of your plans you can fulfil before you land in a wheelchair or just die. So it is better to hammer away early at those goals. And we won't be young forever.\n\n"}], [{"title": "How do you plan stuff out?

It has one job: pick up  cargo in Boston, carry it 570 miles to Charleston, making no stops along  the way, and then make the reverse. This train completes that trip  daily, with no problems, working with its conductor to improve its time  and carry load, inching towards perfection.\nThen  one day that train hits a cow in Pittsburgh. Completely pulverizes it,  turning it into an explosion of meat, bone and hide. The train puts on a  brave face, trying to stay its course, keeping in mind the smiling  faces of Charleston, diligently waiting for their cargo. Meanwhile sinew  and entrails start to gum up the machinery.\n\u201cI  would\u2019ve stopped if I had seen it,\u201d the train thinks to itself, \u201cnext  time I\u2019ll just be more observant, that will stop the problem.\u201d\nThe  train diligently trudges onward despite the damage, still a gleaming  beacon of industry even bloodied and gummed. When the train gets to  Charleston the conductor hops out and starts to oil the engine, do  regular maintenance work and the like.\n\u201cHey  there\u2019s cow in your train,\u201d says a little boy with a pinwheel. \u201cI think  that might be bad for it.\u201d The conductor nods to the boy with a smile,  and tells him not to worry.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just checked the engine and the old beauty is in perfect working order.\u201d\n\u201cBut there\u2019s like, gross, bloody meat all up in the wheels and bands and things.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you the conductor? Because I have a fucking striped hat and my pockets are full of conductor money.\u201d\n\u201cOkay I\u2019m just saying-\u201c\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s sweet of you to worry. But the train is okay.\u201d\nAnd  with that the train picks up its cargo, and makes its way back to  Boston. It trudges through tunnels and hills, across beautiful vistas,  and it even gets a little wistful at the work it\u2019s done. The conductor  keeps it steady and on pace despite not being able to understand why  it\u2019s not quite running at full speed, but he compensates by doubling  down his efforts.\nWhen the train reaches Pittsburgh it hits another cow.\n\u201cGod  dammit,\u201d the train thinks, slightly shocked, \u201cI was BEING CAREFUL. WHO  KEEPS PUTTING THESE COWS IN THE ROAD? I work long hours, I grind the  rail everyday, just fine, and now suddenly out of nowhere I\u2019ve got cow  guts in my beautiful machinery. It\u2019s not fair!\u201d\n\u201cI  know it\u2019s not fair,\u201d says the conductor, who can hear the trains  thoughts for the purposes of the metaphor. \u201cFair doesn\u2019t matter. Boston  matters, and we have cargo to deliver.\u201d\n\u201cNO. I think I want to hit a few more fucking cows,\u201d says the train, in a needlessly terse tone.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that, you\u2019re just upset. What you really want is Boston. Boston is where the trip to Charleston starts!\u201d\nThe  train agrees and continues, somewhat hastily, towards the end of the  track. By this point the train is popping and snapping along, there\u2019s so  much cow stuck in it that it might as well be traveling through four  feet of thick swamp mud. The train, exhausted pulls into Boston, and the  conductor is thrilled with another successful trip.\n\u201cOkay, time to get back to Charleston,\u201d says the giddy conductor.\n\u201cWhat if there are more cows?\u201d thinks the now traumatized train. \u201cAnd fuck me, I\u2019m barely moving here.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense!  Let\u2019s get back on the road!\u201d But when the conductor flips his trusty  switches, the train just won\u2019t start. \u201cNow don\u2019t be so difficult, I know  I\u2019m flipping the right switches, we have a Charleston to get to!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe  it\u2019s all the meat in your wheels and stuff,\u201d says pinwheel kid, who now  lives in Boston. \u201cI don\u2019t think you ever really addressed that.\u201d\n\u201cHey, brat, I love your pinwheel, but I think I know my train best. It can run just fine with the contents of two cows in it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay but you\u2019re an hour late, and i know you have a pocket watch.\u201d\n\u201cHey how about shut up?\u201d\n\u201cLook  I\u2019m just a kid who likes trains and pinwheels, I\u2019m no expert. But I  think taking a day off to clean your train would make it happier.\u201d\nWith  a long pause the conductor weighs the pros and cons, and, realizing  that his train is slipping behind his standards, lets out a heavy sigh.\n\u201cYou  might be right kid. All I want is to get to Charleston quickly,  reliably and with minimal incident. If taking a day off to scrub my  train with a giant toothbrush or something is going to do that for me,  then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\u201cI actually spend a lot of time poking dead things with sticks, would you like some help? I\u2019m kind of a pro.\u201d\nIn  the end, they fixed up the train, and it was better off for it. The  train never truly learned to avoid cows, because it had developed an  almost sick obsession with acting like it wasn\u2019t going to hit them and  then hitting them anyways, but the conductor now knew to remove  carcasses when they came around.\nThe End\nFor  the purposes of this metaphor: The train: ExTJ, The conductor: Te, The journey: Getting shit done, The pinwheel kid: an FP pal with eyes\n\n"}, {"title": "ENTJ\u2019s pursuing career in the scientific or medical fields (self.entj)", "likes": "26", "comments": "21", "content": "It\u2019s clear as day that ENTJ\u2019s strive for leadership roles and naturally fit into corporate world.

It reflects the\u00a0inner self\u00a0of an individual and expresses that faithfully, while simultaneously creating a mental state in which the individual feels at ease.

Adapting and doing the right things based what is happening in the world around them and where the world is heading towards - in other words, timing.\nOne key concept in \"The Prince\" by Machiavelli is that being adaptable to the times is what will lead to success. The analogy Machiavelli used was that an aggressive King will be a failed ruler who impoverish his nation and people if he were born in a time of peace, and a soft-nature and contemplative king will destroy his nation if he were born in a time of conflicts and wars.\nThis analogy in essence captures the key Machiavellian concept of adapting to one's situation and the timing of the world. A competent and successful king is one who is Machiavellian. He knows to be aggressive when he senses tension building up in the world around him and sees opportunities which allow him to attack and expand his nation. He knows to focus inward and expand social policies and the economy when in time period of peace and the world around him is stable and governed by alliances.\nI have observed that this notion is true in the real world as well. Those who constantly succeed in life makes the right decisions at the right time. The successful people we read about are the ones who went into the right industries at the right timing for where the world was heading towards.\nBill Gates or Steve Jobs who created their companies when the computer hardware and software industries were primitive and had potential for tremendous growth. Jeff Bezos who created a business on the internet because he saw how fast the internet industry was growing, or Larry Page who also started Google when the internet industry was taking off. Steve Schwarzman who created Blackstone because he saw the timing in the market was right and finance and Wallstreet was expanding rapidly and globally. The list goes on.\nPerhaps many successful individuals, including those I've mentioned above, did not make decisions based on Machiavellian reasons. They were dreamers and idealists pursuing their grand vision regardless of whether the world was truly ready for them or not. However, just because their reasoning wasn't Machiavellian doesn't mean what they did wasn't. In fact, I think that all successful people are Machiavellian in their actions despite some of them not being purposefully so.\nThe point is, being smart and successful is to be opportunistic and aware of the situation one is in and the timing of the world around oneself. Where is the world heading to, what are the right actions to take in this situation, is the timing right? This applies to workplace, schools, as it does in grander pursuits and ambitions in life. Be forceful with a coworker when you need to, take risks when the timing is right, listen attentively and be cooperative in tense situations at work or school, etc. Be entrepreneurial and pursue your dreams in life when the timing is right. For every one Steve Jobs who chased after their dreams of an ideal vision, there are many others who failed because they were born in the wrong time period or their dreams and ideas were too unrealistic and not right for what the world needed at that time.\nWe all have dreams and pursuits in life, and you need a force of will and strong ambitions to succeed, but the key to success is to be aware of yourself and the timing and the world around you. Take control of your own life. Be smart and adaptable so not to let your fate hang on to the hopes of the timing of the world or those around you.\n\n"}, {"title": "Let's speculate (self.entj)", "likes": "4", "comments": "14", "content": "Hey ENTJs,\nAnyone got any fun theories on stocks to keep an eye on at the moment?

This is when we will put in an insane amount of effort to keep you close, the next step is when we say something (this obviously only happens after we know you and feel like you could be in our lives for/ever - a long time) and we say something like \"I love you\" or \"You aren't a friend you are family\" this is something very serious as with us saying that we value you literally on the level that people value blood relation (or perhaps even more).\nSaying we don't want to talk about something right now: This one is tough, we want to listen to peoples problems cause we like feeling like that solid rock that people can lean on, but it takes quite a bit of trust for us to just casually talk about shit, the 2 best approaches for anyone else to us is to 1 respect what we say and let us try and deal with it on our own terms (this is not the most healthy option for us to be completely honest) OR if you can be more assertive than us make us talk to you (for me and most of the ENTJ's i know IRL you pushing us to talk shows us that you actually care), this is cause we will generally fight back and people that only want to know gossipy stuff about you will probably give up after a little bit of us fighting back where as people that really care about us will know that we are talking shit and dealing with something and then force us to cope with it. This level of investment from the other person shows us that we are valued and we will be much more likely to open up (but probably only if we have already started trusting this person).\n\nUsing these (not so) short examples the point I want to make is ENTJ's don't just say things to say things, when we say something there is more than likely at least a few reasons making us say something, whether it be in terms of affection or dislike and lastly on top of all this seriousness we will give you 110% of it, if we say you are important we will hit you with a lot of affection and time cause we see you as worth the investment, if we say you are a tool we will tell you and probably actively try and make you fix your shit OR avoid you cause we don't even think you are worth the time. \nWe are people of \"Quality vs Quantity\" so we tend to filter through people and only keep the ones we really think are worth it\n\u200b\nTL;DR When we say things we really mean what we say and there definitely was a fair bit of thought behind the reason for saying it \nNow for the discussion part - Do you guys have similar experiences where people just don't seem to get what you are saying ?

What a lot of people perceive to be arrogance is really just us voicing opinions that we believe to be empirically correct after lots of research/consideration, not an extension of ego. \nFor example, I remember a time years ago in Middle School when a teacher prefaced the Greek myth of Narcissus by semi-joking to the class that the story would really resonate with me.
