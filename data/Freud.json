For starters, the bust of Freud in the intro sequence changes to reflect the episode name. I am just wondering if anyone noticed or read anything interesting or managed to peel back layers.\nFor e.g.-\n\nInspector Kiss (imo) reflected superego. His profession of punishing people who break societal rules also seems symbolic.\nMucha, the opera singer, reflected oral fixations. The fact that he was a singer and he also bit people when he was hypnotized was an interesting pattern.\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Question of Freuds dream theory / the unconscious (self.Freud)", "likes": "10", "comments": "4", "content": "(Disclaimer I'm still very new to Freud, so please forgive).\n\u200b\nWhat is the unconscious actually trying to achieve in a dream? -- I understand it's disguising messages to get past our censor, but is it only pre-occupied with trying to fulfil basic primordial desires (sex, food, anger etc)?\nHow would this explain dreams that offer deep and meaningful insight, once interpreted? \nFrom my limited understanding, it seems like dreams would be purely destructive and bad for us if they were only driven by unconscious desires?\nAlso, side question: is the unconscious good, bad, or neither?

Many times his disciples approached him and said, \u201cWe can psychoanalyze you,\u201d but he always refused. He was afraid.\nThis legend is very symbolic. Out of the fear of losing authority, he was afraid to expose himself as he was. But a real man of authority is never afraid of losing it. He cannot lose it; there is no way to lose it. This is the difference between a man of authority and an authoritative man. The authoritative man has no real authority; he is a pretender.

Hoffmann himself\n\u200b\nIt is often mentioned that Freud\u2019s  Psychoanalytical theory has influenced literature very considerably.  Regarding stories that aspire to cause dread, his article on the Uncanny  in Literature provides good insight \u2013 particularly his interpretation  of \u201cThe Sandman\u201d, \u00a0E.T.A. Hoffmann\u2019s bleak and magical story of fiery  circles, monsters and doppelgangers, \u00a0is worth mentioning...\nThe  Sandman, the eponymous fiend of this story, is both a magical entity (a  flying beaked demon that abducts little children and uses their eyes so  as to feed his own offspring) and a dyad of mysterious men: an  ominously looking old lawyer, Coppelius, and a merchant of eyeglasses,  called Giuseppe Coppola. Both names etymologically are derived from the  Italian word for \u201ceye\u201d, and their links to the monstrous Sandman of  legend do not stop there.\nThe Lawyer Coppelius\nCoppelius  is a very unpleasant-looking man, who seems to despise children. The  protagonist of the story, the student Nathaniel, recalls how he hated  and feared Coppelius ever since he was a boy. While at first the  antipathy was caused by disgust at how the old man looked, as well as  due to the antagonistic attitude he consistently demonstrated when  invited to Nathaniel's family home by his father, later on Nathaniel  comes to regard Coppelius as the actual murderer of his father \u2013 whose  death took place during a chemical, possibly alchemy-related,  experiment. \u00a0\nCoppelius had already been  fused in Nathaniel's mind with the mythical Sandman \u2013 the child\u2019s  governess was reckless enough to fill his mind with tales of horror, and  it should be noted that she was the one who first suggested that his  father\u2019s night-time guest was the Sandman. Nathaniel always loved  stories of mystery and the macabre, so the repugnant and terrifying  figure of the winged and beaked Sandman soon assumed a central position  in his personal pantheon of ghouls.\nCoppelius  manages to escape after the apparent accident that killed Nathaniel's  father, and Nathaniel will only see him again \u2013 or at any rate believe  he saw him \u2013 years later, while studying far away from his home city.\nThe optometrist Giuseppe Coppola\nCoppola  first appears to the student Nathaniel wishing to sell him some of his  wares \u2013 lenses, small telescopes and eyeglasses. Nathaniel immediately  feels repulsed, because the visage of this merchant is uncannily similar  to the lawyer Coppelius'. At length, he decides to buy one of the  elegant lenses, which he will soon put to use so to have a better look  at the object of his desires: the university professor\u2019s beautiful  daughter, Olympia.\nUnfortunately for  Nathaniel the gained ability to have a closer look at Olympia - a girl  normally isolated and confined to her room and only making her  appearance by the window - results to dangerous infatuation and the  dreaded sense that something is not quite right with her... For the rest  of the story he will persistently attempt to negate his worries,  despite the fact that they are consequently fueled by rumors circulating  among the students, according to which Olympia is bizarrely wooden and  barely ever speaks. Nathaniel is enamored and distances himself from his  old friends as well as his old fiancee who stayed back at their  hometown.\nTwo fathers, two father-killers and two sons\nHoffmann  uses doppelgangers in most of his works. In the Sandman there are at  least two notable pairs: Nathaniel has two fathers, the one who died  during the alchemy experiment and his university professor (who wishes  Nathaniel to marry Olympia, his daughter, and thus become his  son-in-law). There are also two killers of the father figure: Coppelius  (said to have caused the death of the father) and Coppola, who comes to  fight with the university professor over ownership of the wooden  automaton known as Olympia and mortally wounds him\u2026\nThere are also, according to Freud, far more crucially two sons:\nFreud  does make a very convincing case when he argues that Olympia, the  life-like piece of machinery, appears to be in reality part of  Nathaniel. Indeed, the reader should note that while Nathaniel lost his  father, Olympia is virtually next to her father all of the time, and  whereas Nathaniel was scared by Coppola/Coppelius and the Sandman,  Olympia is perfectly fine with being restricted and ordered around,  docile and well-behaved. Freud argues that Olympia alludes to what the  child, threatened by a potentially dangerous father, created as a means  to avoid friction with the source of dread. Olympia can never antagonize  the father, whereas Nathaniel keeps getting into considerable trouble  in his attempt to come to terms with the various splits of the  father-image.\nIn the end, Nathaniel only  wishes to become one with Olympia, and if Freud\u2019s analysis is correct  then this wish is only one for self-completion. The split part of the  youth can no longer stay away, it cannot be pushed away to another city  and live in perpetual exile. Of course Nathaniel himself is not aware of  the special tie to Olympia, yet everything about the story leads to the  conclusion that this uncanny dance of living and wooden forms is  orchestrated as an unwitting ceremony in honor of the father-image:  Nathaniel and Olympia risk losing their very eyes \u2013 with Freud referring  his reader to the psychoanalytic theory that links fear of losing one\u2019s  eyes to fear of castration.\nIn conclusion\nE.T.A.  Hoffmann\u2019s The Sandman is, arguably, one of the most elegant works of  dark romanticism. An uncanny story, presented masterfully \u2013 and one  where the deeper meaning is allowed to remain hidden, so that the reader  is free to be dazzled, surprised, horrified and indeed take part  mentally in this macabre dance of hidden emotions and repressed  memories. It was certainly a poignant decision by Freud to focus on this  work in his article, since its use of the uncanny in high literature is  paradigmatic.\nBy Kyriakos Chalkopoulos (https://www.patreon.com/posts/27630785)\n\n"}], [{"title": "Understanding Sublimation (self.Freud)", "likes": "9", "comments": "1", "content": "We all have impulses to do socially inappropriate things, we have sexual fantasies, that if we manifest in public, would be less than ideal.

You newcomers always long for what you have lost without noticing what you have gained\u201d said Sigmund as he walked toward Stan Lee who was sitting off by himself look down on the world he just left. \n\u201cExcuse me, who are you and why would you be looking for me\u201d - replied Stan Lee \n\u201cReally, I guess I should not have expected you to have the decency to even know the man for whom your life work is based on given that you never bothered to give me credit for my contributions to your movies\u201d - answered Sigmund Freud \nClearly puzzled by the this statement Stan Lee smile and just replied \u201cYou must have me confused with some one else sir because my life work were comics. There were just things from my imagination that I hoped helped some enjoy the time they have down below.\u201d\n\u201cYou are correct, the error is my mine. I have created expectations that are now clearly unrealistic. I guess you could say I let me \u201cId \u201cget the best me\u201d - clearly entertained by his pun Sigmund began to turn to walk away. \nStan did not completely understand what was happening but given that at times he struggled to see the significance of his life work, he was clearly intrigued by the fact that it seems like this man may have a unique perspective of the universe he created. So against his better instincts he shouted \u201cWait, what is an \u201cId\u201d and what does your work have to do with mine\u201d\nFreud always delighted to discuss his theory of the sub-consciousness turned around and replied \u201c Well Stan, The \u201cId\u201d is all that we enter the world with. It is the part of you that gives you all of your most basic desires and instincts. It is what makes a baby desires its mom\u2019s breast but also what makes man seek out those of his lover. It is the essence of humanity that is so basic that it is driving force in every human being.\u201d\n\u201cIs this what you believe you see in my marvel universe? If it is basic to every person wouldn\u2019t you see it in every movie?\u201d - asked Stan  \n\u201c The Id, while the most powerful part of the sub-conscious, is just one part of the sub-conscious\u201d replied Fraud \nIntrigued by this Stan had to know \u201c How many parts of the sub-conscience are there\u201d\n\u201cThey are three \u201c answer Freud \nContinuing the conversation Lee \u201c Do they also have names and what do they do?\u201d\nClearly excited by the Lee\u2019s interest in his theory Freud began to explain \u201c The other two parts are the Ego and the super Ego \u201c\nInterjecting  Lee  wondered out loud \u201c Is that like what makes someone think highly of them selves and really really highly of themselves?\u201d\nAnnoyed by this common mis-understating Freud just said \u201cNo, if you would restrained your Id for a second more I was just about to explain.\u201d\n\u201cMy apologies, please continue\u201d replied Lee \n\u201c The ego is actually the part of our sub-conscience that deals in reality. It is what tries to restrain the unrealistic desires of the Id. \u201c continued  Freud \n\u201c Sorry to interrupt again but I don\u2019t get why one part of the sub-conscience would need to be restrained by another part of sub-conscience\u201d asked Lee\nExpecting this question as it is commonly asked, all be in  different ways, Freud explained \u201cThe id is the most power thing inside of us but it is like a wild horse. It is great on the open plains but in society it can be destructive. The ego thus is the rider on the back of the horse trying to control it, even though it is not as powerful\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I think I get it. What about the super-ego, it is just a stronger form of the ego\u201d Lee asked clearly interested in what he was learning. \nWith a smile, which was unusual for Freud he replied \u201c not quite. The super Ego is the expectations placed upon us by the world. It is the part of our sub-conscience that strives for perfection.  You can say it is the societal burdens placed upon us by our parents\u201d\n\u201cInteresting but how does any of this relate to the Marvel Universe i created \u201c asked Lee \n\u201cYou really don\u2019t see it do you \u201d asked Freud rhetorically while shaking his head from side to side.  \nAs Lee began to answer Freud interjected \u201c Let me see if I can explain this to you in a way that you can understand. Each of the main characters of your Marvel Universe can be placed in a category of either the Id, Ego or Super-ego. \u201d\n\u201c Which ones do you consider the Id\u201d asked Freud \n\u201c Hulk, of course \u201c Began Freud \n\u201cThat one I think seems, obvious\u201d interjected Lee\n\u201c Then there is Iron Man, Dr. Strange and Captain Marvel\u201d continued Freud \n\u201c Is it because of how they were before they got their power and how all of their powers are tied to or affected by their emotions and impulses?\u201d asked Lee \n\u201cExactly, well perceived \u201c  replied Freud, clearly pleased.  \n\u201cWould Black Widow and Hawkeye be in the ego group?\u201d asked Lee \n\u201cYes but also Spiderman and Ant-man. These main characters, along with some supporting characters, represents to me the conscience of the group. They are based more on reality\u201d explained Freud \n\u201c How are Spiderman and Ant-man reality based?\u201d interjected Lee\n\u201c While their powers may not reality based their lives and desire to stay attached to the normal world is. Both Spiderman an Ant-man want to be apart of the normal world and have a  normal life. They do not try to separate themselves from like some of the other Avengers.\u201d - answered Freud \n\u201cI can see where you are going with that.\u201d replied Lee with a smile on his face. Thinking that he now had a better understanding of the system that Freud was explaining and with only a couple Hero left Lee went on \u201c Then Captan America, Black Panther and Thor are the Super Ego \u201c.\n\u201cExactly\u201d replied Freud \n\u201cWhat about the Guardians of the Galaxy, which category would they be placed in\u201d Asked Lee\n\u201cGiven that each member of the crew are so emotional and instinctually driven they would be considered to be Id\u201d answered Freud  \n\u201cSo is that it, is this all of your theory that over laps with my characters\u201d - Stan wondered out loud.  \nShaking his head again at how little of his theories Stan really understood Freud replied \u201cof course not.\u201d He continued \u201c And i am not sure if you are just acting as if you are not aware of my theories or if these over laps are really just coincidence\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you say that\u201d asked Stan who was some what taken aback by the accusation. \nClearly upset, Freud replied \u201cbecause you literal named your greatest Villain after part of my theory\u201d \nPuzzled Stan Lee replied \u201c Which part\u201d\nControlling his irritation Freud replied \u201c The death drive, which is referred to as Thanatos. \u201c\nStan Lee with a little smile on his face asked \u201c But isn\u2019t that Greek for death Thanatos?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d - replied Freud clearly somewhat surprised that Stan was aware of this \n\u201cSo how can Thanos be named after your \u201cdeath drive\u201d when your death drive is just greek for death\u201d asked Stan with a clear smirk on his face. \nSmiling as if he was dealing with a child Freud reeled \u201c Because the name is not the only thing that linked Thanos to my theory of our drive to death. Thanos entire motivation throughout the movies is a testament to my theory of  the death drive or desire.\u201d\n\u201c But Thanos in his mind is trying to save everyone. How is that a \u201cdeath drive\u201d?asked Stan \n\u201c I am realizing that you truly must not have been aware of my theories because you truly do not grasp what the death  drive represents \u201d replied Freud \n\u201c I am not sure if I am supposed to be happy or insulted by that \u201c stated Stan with a clear smile of his face. \nContinuing on Freud explained that the \u201cdrive to death\u201d is about giving life through destruction like how an ever green pines  needs fire to reproduce and how this is exactly what Thanos is attempting to do. He is trying to save the world by destroying it. He also went on to explain How the avengers as a group represents Eros, the life instinct. So in the end it is the sub-conscious coming together to fight death that we all find so relatable.  After explaining all of that Freud just smiled and ask Stan \u201cWill Thanos be defeated similarly to how Thanatos was defeated by Sisyphus ?\u201d\nStan Lee just replied with a smile on his face \u201c I guess you will have to watch like everyone else to see.\u201d\n\n"}, {"title": "Original Psychotherapy Video (self.Freud)", "likes": "2", "comments": 0, "content": "Hi all!

To understand the Oedipus complex, we must begin by briefly examining Freud\u2019s psychosexual stages. Freud believed that children go through five stages during their sexual development. In the oral stage, the child primarily receives sensations by mouth such as sucking and swallowing. In the anal stage, toilet training is the main fixation.The third stage is the phallic stage. Boys begin to manipulate  their penises for pleasure during the phallic stage, while girls develop penis envy as they discover boys have penises. It is during this stage that children experience the Oedipus complex.\nBoth boys and girls experience the Oedipus complex in the phallic stage differently.The Oedipus complex for a boy is characterized by the boy developing feelings of love and sexual fantasies towards his mother. This is combined with a feeling of envy and rivalry towards his father, whom the child wants to get rid of. For a girl, the Oedipus complex is characterized by anger and resentment directed towards her mother because she didn\u2019t give her a penis. In response, the girl will develop strong feelings of love for her father, and a desire for his penis. Additionally, the girl will become envious of her mother\u2019s relationship with her father, and will view her mother as a rival. \nThe ending of the Oedipus complex for boys is due to the castration complex. When a boy learns that females lack a penis, he develops an intense fear of castration from his father figure as punishment for desiring his mother. Punishment for exploring his genitals from either the child\u2019s mother or father can also contribute to the castration complex. Freud describes this as the greatest trauma boys experience during their early lives. In response to the castration complex, the boy will repress the feelings of desire towards his mother. It can thus be said that the threat of castration is what ends Oedipus complex for boys, but that it is the lack of a penis that starts the Oedipus complex for girls. \nThe Oedipus complex has developmental consequences that are different for both boys and girls. Following the Oedipus complex, both boys and girls repress the experience into the unconscious and enter into a period of latency until puberty. When the Oedipus complex ends for a boy, the boy will replace his object-cathexis of his mom with an intensification of identification with his father or mother. Intensification of identification with the father is most common for boys, and fixes the boy\u2019s masculine character. When the Oedipus complex ends for a girl, she typically has an intensification of her identification with her mom, fixing her feminine character. It is also possible for a girl to experience an identification with her father, but not as common (perhaps Freud would have used this to explain transgender individuals... just a thought). Freud believed that the general outcome of the Oedipus complex was the union of identifications with the mother and father to form the super-ego.\nSources:\nAn Outline of Psycho-Analysis by Freud, and also The Ego and the Id by Freud. \nPlease note that this is only my interpretation of the Oedipus complex based on my studies of Freud! If anyone disagrees with my interpretation, or notices anything I've explained incorrectly, PLEASE point it! In my opinion, Freud was really onto something with his work on the Oedipus complex, although many today discredit the complex entirely (and laugh at the idea of penis envy). However, I consider the concept of the Oedipus complex to be brilliant, especially when one takes into account that Freud didn't have the knowledge from developmental psychology and neuroscience that we have today. I still find the concept of the Oedipus complex very useful for understanding human behavior, even though many don't take it seriously.
