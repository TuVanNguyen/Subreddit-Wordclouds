I was not expecting this. Thanks for the messages and comments guys. \nAfter all that my husband and I called his sister to see if she wanted to take in MIL. We told her what happened. After all the shock and horror, SIL goes \"Ask her to pay you back. She's already received her stimulus money, she should have enough.\" This was news to us. SIL confirms that MIL told her that she's got it already. I lost it. She moves into my house, leeches off of us knowing full well that husband and I have taken financial hits due to the pandemic, gets her stimulus money and DOES NOTHING? \nI wanted her out of my house. Indian cultural norms dictating I respect my elders be damned. Husband finally gets that I'm being serious and does something about it. \nLong story short, he told her she needed to pay us for the groceries and leave. She fought it for a few hours \"my son won't throw me out, this can't be his idea.\" My husband had enough of the whining and told her that she pays up and gets out, or our entire extended family will know exactly why she's being booted from his house. That scared her into compliance.\nThe antics didn't end there though. While she was packing her things, she would \"forget\" and walk around the house wearing her shoes or put her shoe clad feet on my couch. Not wearing your outside shoes inside the house is a cultural thing. \nYesterday, I made paneer. The look on her face when she realised that I could make Indian food with nothing but milk and lemon juice was absolutely priceless.  \nShe left a while ago. We got our money back and I'm ordering stuff from Amazon. I told my family what happened and they'll be sending me a care package of rice, flour and my favorite spices to tide me over until I can get my hands on my own. \nI'm feeling great.

She just now realized I was serious about cutting her out if she kept pushing for me to take my kids around my abusive uncle. But she knows I was fucking right and has an metric ass ton of shit to fix with me.\nA lot has happened in the family from when I dropped the rope.\n\nsome of my other cousins (three of them specifically) that absolutely hate the uncle too broke their NC with him and too call him out on his behavior: if guessed that this didn\u2019t go well... you\u2019d be right \n\nCousin A : It would be an understatement to say he went berserk and tried to physically assault my cousin A, in front of her husband. Her husband who\u2019s a police officer for their city, her husband who also happened to be wearing his body cam because he just had a \u201cfeeling\u201d shit would go down. They shared the video with us in case any of the cousins were feeling weak at the \u201ccancer\u201d card everyone keeps playing. At first all you hear is my cousin politely airing her grievances and being honest that she doesn\u2019t trust him and doesn\u2019t want to bring her kids around him based on his history and how traumatizing and terrifying it was for her - she didn\u2019t even finish talking before he starts verbally berating her and calling her horrible names - \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve changed, we\u2019re leaving\u201d is all she said in the quietest and calmest voice; and he flipped the table and went for the throat with one hand and fist in the other!! And then it was garbled and theres yelling from her husband for her to call the cops now, he\u2019s got uncle pinned and I think either a foot or knee on his neck (either way uncle is on the ground cursing and screaming that he\u2019ll kill cousin and cousins husband). \ncousin B and cousin C : they went together, neither of them wanted to bring their wives to meet the uncle; and after seeing how cousin A was attacked they didn\u2019t want to risk anything happening. They went to go check on my aunt (uncles wife) because you only catch a glimpse of her in the body cam video and something just looked wrong to them. [back story, when we were younger my aunt was absolutely gorgeous, like she had the adorable librarian with the big glasses feel and the softest most marshmallow personality, how she ever got stuck with uncle is a mystery]. They don\u2019t have body cams so this is just paraphrasing what they said, but they said that seeing her was absolutely soul shatteringly heart breaking, and these are guys that don\u2019t use words like this btw! She looks like a walking corpse; malnourished, bruises (fresh bruises), she had a glass thrown at her face and it shattered so now one of her eyes don\u2019t work and she has an eye patch over it, limping. They took a picture and part of me wishes I could post it, just to show what horror that poor woman has gone through and why I HATE that man so much. They said the entire time uncle kept talking about how nothing good has ever happened in his life, and how he needs money for his \u201ccancer\u201d. Cousin B asked when he got diagnosed; uncles response he didn\u2019t he just has all the symptoms from what google said and he\u2019s trying to collect the money before he goes to the doctor. Cousin C asked him how much he\u2019s saved from the rest of the family donating to him, he got defensive and said he didn\u2019t have much left because he needed to pay bills and his \u201cworthless wife is too ugly to work now\u201d. And that\u2019s when My cousin B asked if she wanted to leave, they offered her a place to stay; and she declined. Uncle got pissssssed, and he tried physically assault cousin B. Now a lot of us as we got older and away from our parents took self defense, married people that could protect us, and/or became people that could protect against him; that\u2019s how much he terrified us). Cousin C tased him, a lot. And then called the cops.\nSo yeah; uncle hasn\u2019t changed Still excessively violent and hateful, cancer is not confirmed, and my aunt is still stuck there by her own design.\nNow when my mom contacted me this morning through Skype because I forgot to block her in there, we had a very serious conversation. I sent her the video and told her about cousins B and Cs visits, and she had no words. \nI asked her honestly Why she hates my kids to the point she would want them to be potentially abused by such an evil man. When she brought out of the family card, I told her family doesn\u2019t hurt family, and if that\u2019s all she\u2019s got I\u2019ll block her again.\nI asked her if she\u2019s seen aunt recently and she said no, so I sent her the photo of when I was 15 with aunt (the last time I ever saw her) and then sent her the recent photo cousin B sent me. I showed her the horror one man inflicted on her. And I asked her again does family have a right to do that? And she broke down and cried, and I honestly had no sympathy. This is when I went a little psycho and just unleashed on her that she was a horrible mom when it came to anything that had to do with her family, she left us to the wolves and NEVER protect us against the horrors. She may have been a good mom with other things, but she failed where she was needed the most. \nIt was a lot of tears for both of us, she had no justification for his behavior once you take the family aspect out of it, and she apologized and begged me to unblock her and that she\u2019d never push again, and missed the boys. \nBut I can\u2019t forgive her and I told her that; also told her she broke my heart when she picked an abusive POS that she can\u2019t even stomach to be around herself, she broke my trust and she has to earn that back as well as my respect.\nMaybe I\u2019m the justno here but I told her if she ever wants to be in my life again or see the kids;\n1) she has to block him, she needs to 100000% cut him out of her life\n2) she needs to start going to therapy to fix the family mentality that is ingrained into her (I might go with her)\n3) she has to apologize and admit she was wrong to all the cousins she tried to force to go see him\n4) she needs to get the other aunts and uncles to fuck off about seeing him\n5) she has to take back telling everyone I was possessed by a demon and tell them the REAL reason I cut her out. \nI told her I don\u2019t care what order these are done in, but they need to be done before I even consider her my mother again.\nEdit to add: we\u2019ve tried getting my aunt away from him before. We called the police, APS, all the domestic abuse resources in our state, the cousins have physically tried to help get her away, but she refuses to leave him and denies all allegations with the authorities are involved. The rare instance she was removed by the authorities, she ran right back to him when she was free.\nEdit 2: \nhe\u2019s in jail right now for trying to assault cousin b and c while on bail for trying to assault cousin a. Aunt is still at the house because SHE WONT FUCKING LEAVE THE HOUSE. And has said herself she doesn\u2019t want to leave and is going to wait for him. We\u2019re getting APS involved to try to get her help\n\n"}, {"title": "MIL-to-be is now banned from my home, chaos ensues.  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "331", "comments": "99", "content": "I've been lucky enough to find a fantastic girlfriend going 2 years strong. We both own houses separate from one another. This arrangement is agreeable with both of us for the time being, but because of the health crisis she is currently staying at my house.\nOur state is currently doing a soft-reopen. This prompted my GF's mother to ask to have dinner with her. She explained that she is at my house and we would like to continue to social distance. As usual, she made her feel guilty and insisted on seeing her. After talking about it, a deal was arranged. Since my GF's mother and father are in good health, they can come over for dinner under the condition that they keep things polite and leave promptly no later than 9pm. In exchange, I'll cook us all a nice meal and remain polite as well. We all agree to those terms.\n7pm rolls around. I have a nice meal ready for us four. The doorbell rings. Only problem, it isn't her mom and dad. It's some of her extended family. 4 of them. My girlfriend's cousin, his wife, and their two kids. The kids start running around my house. I'm not a kid person. Her cousin says that GF's mom invited them. Shit. I plan to show them out very soon but it was pouring rain and at the time I was still making an effort to be polite.\nDoorbell rings again, two more vague relatives at the door. I feel like that scene in the Hobbit where more and more people keep coming through the door, wanting to eat all my food. I'm waiting for GF's parents to show up so I can throw them all out in unison. Parents arrive shortly after and we have a chat. Not only did they violate the simple rules I had in my own house, but this is completely unsafe. There is still a pandemic!\nI must have lost track of the kids because I hear one crying like she'd been hurt. When we get to them it was clear they had been in a room they weren't supposed to go in. To clarify, me and my girlfriend are very kinky. I have a small room in my house dedicated to storage of our adult items. The little boy had taken a whip from a low-sitting cubbie and hit his sister with it.\nNot only was half of my GF's family seeing a very private area of my home, but since they hadn't had the brains to watch their kids, now they've come in contact with a space that kids should under no circumstances be exposed to. Upon seeing the room, my GF's mother gasps and makes a comment about how \"this is the road that lesbianism leads you down\". That was it, I saw red. I said that what I do in my home is my goddamn business. I also told her how disrespectful it was to bring uninvited guests to someone's home. Therefore, she will never be getting an invite again. I shoo them all out.\nMy GF isn't talking very much, I think she's embarrassed over today's events which I completely understand. We had a short conversation, she told me that I was so mean to everyone and I could have accommodated them. I told her that her mom broke the agreement, not me. Her mother is now blowing her phone up, thinking she's in a sex cult. I'm not sure where I stand in all of this, I could have been nicer but lines were crossed today.\n\u200b\nUPDATE: This situation happened 2 days ago. Me and my GF have had a more in depth discussion since then, but she still insists that I was the rude one. Her mother is profusely trying to call me, and is still constantly texting her daughter. She has come to the conclusion that the room she saw was some kind of torture chamber and that her daughter is in an abusive relationship. Naturally, I am the villain. She is demanding that her daughter text her regularly or she will contact the police about a possible domestic abuse going on in the house. This seems like some kind of blackmail. We're at the point where I've gotten my GF to agree that her mom was rude and lacking etiquette, but she thinks I am guilty of the same thing.\nI love my GF dearly but this whole situation is not it. I come from a dysfunctional abusive family and this gives me similar vibes. I've advised my GF to text her mother one last time that she is fine and just block her for a while, she won't do it. I've also been getting bipolar messages from MIL saying things ranging from \"I'll pray for you\" to \"what have you done to my daughter?? I WILL CONTACT THE AUTHORITIES!!!\". I am at a loss. I'm working from home with clients and it's incredibly distracting to see those messages pop up. GF has been tearful and has been resisting my efforts to comfort her. According to AmITheAsshole I am apparently not the asshole, but it sure feels like it at home. Any advice? I'll be checking reddit throughout the day so I can answer additional questions if you have them.\n\u200b\nUPDATE 2: I have shown GF a lot of the comments so far. She was upset but has finally admitted that her mother was very controlling in her childhood and this has been a long time coming. She's apologized for not having my back and turning the whole situation on me. We've agreed to do online couples counselling and she will also be doing individual counselling. Some of your comments really shook her up (in a good way) and it's becoming clear to the both of us that this was most likely a power move on the part of FMIL. GF is still unconvinced that her mother didn't have good intentions but she at least admits that this is something she's done before, especially in situations she isn't in control of. I am GF's first female partner and FMIL isn't too pleased about that. I haven't been able to convince GF to block her mother, but she is no longer responding to her. If the police come, we will show them the messages and the 47 missed calls on my phone. We are both going to sit down tonight and discuss new and firmer rules when it comes to FMIL. I have stood firm on FMIL's perma-ban. Any new rule suggestions would be appreciated.\n\n"}, {"title": "I went mama bear for my godson on the JustNo hag  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "3460", "comments": "188", "content": "Well, ladies and gents, the just no reached a new level of hell no tonight.

Tonight however he was a bit fussy because he's tired of being inside and he wanted a video call with his birdy. \nSo I'm on the phone with my little monster and we're just talking when from the other end of the house I hear the signs of a full fledged impending hissy fit. I know he hears it as well because he gets this look on his face when he hears her voice. We go on for a few minutes before he asks for his song, and before I have a chance to react I hear her screaming that I meed to get off my ass, stop babying the r***rd and bring her a trash bag.\nY'all... This is the sweetest kid I know, and the look on his face when he heard this bloated beached whale call him retarded had me seeing red. I'm still not fully recovered from my hospital stay in March but I do not let my nieces, nephews or Godkids get treated like that. I held it together long enough to sing him his song and spoke to his mom for a minute before I hauled myself out of bed and let me tell you that going off on her felt fantastic. I threw everything on the table from her hijacking our wedding to the state of the house after I spent 19 days in the hospital and everything in between. I just it all out and then promptly turned to my husband and said this was also on him for letting her get away with acting like a spoiled brat for so long.\nI packed up some stuff and all my valuables, called my closest friend and am currently in her guest house with 5 kittens fighting over who gets to lay in my lap and a mama cat who seems happy for a break laying on a chair next to the bed.\nI don't know if I'll be going back, other than to get the rest of my stuff. I can handle a lot, but that was just too damn far in my book.\nUPDATE: First of all, WOW! The response to this was overwhelming. \nI've spoken with my husband and he agrees that for the time being, staying at my friends is best for me. He has contacted our lawyer and will be coming over with some options later. As for MIL, she got herself arrested last night and put on a 1 week hold after she threw a 3 foot brass candle holder at hubs. She also managed to shatter a glass display cabinet in the living room in the process so hubs has hired someone to come in and make sure there are no shards of glass hiding anywhere. \nI woke up this morning with mama and kittens tucked up against my back (king size bed, plenty of room, but of course they had to be all up in my bubble) and had a wonderful breakfast of biscuits and gravy brought out by my friend and her brother, who is like my own big brother. \nDespite everything going on, my friends have organized a little bbq for this evening to celebrate me finally telling the MIL off.\n\n"}, {"title": "MIL just contacted me about her \u201cparty\u201d  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "473", "comments": "26", "content": "I\u2019ve been really working hard to keep it all together with COVID - work, DD\u2019s school, home..

DD is pretty good about being independent but took a couple weeks for everyone to get there.   So I had a coworker  lecture me about being delayed on a piece of work like I am going to have the same productivity I am going to have in the office.

I just finished getting my emotions out and MIL calls my phone! Like she hardly ever calls me.  And hasn\u2019t spoken to DD since Easter.  She called DH to just tell him the party she was going to have during the stay at home was cancelled 2 weeks ago. Well she called me to say the party is on this Saturday.  It\u2019s going to be Easter and a celebration of my nieces birthday.  I already celebrated my niece\u2019s birthday with a Zoom call that her mom did.  So MIL tells me this and I said we aren\u2019t going and I told her that DH said no.  DH saw my breakdown earlier with work and I gave him the phone and he shut it down.   I first want to know why she would ever call me and ask and can she sense when I am weak? DH explained to her it wasn\u2019t going to happen with COVID and told her that if she should talk to DD later he doesn\u2019t want to hear MIL trying to convince DD.  DH is very serious about COVID that no amount of manipulation is going to affect that position.   She tried to explain she had gloves and masks like that is going to help.  What I love about this is she has no manipulation tactic.  DD doesn\u2019t like her, DH is more concerned about COVID and she hasn\u2019t done herself any favors with me.

I also mourn what he wasn't and all the strife he caused us.  \nFor a brief time I thought DH should return SIL's call.\nFast forward to today when we saw the obituary.   DH is listed, my kids are listed. Every spouse of every surviving relative is listed except for me.

This confirms more than ever that they see me as the problem, and only the incubator they tolerate.  I'm sure they blame the NC on me, despite that it was me that kept it from happening earlier.   In their twisted mind my kids are really more JNSIL's kids since they share the same \"blood\".

JustYesDad and I stare at her. \nJustYesDad: Soft_Stranger, where did he touch you?\nMe: On my thigh. \nJustYesDad looks at MW and says \"In what world do you think it's ok for a 12 year old boy to touch an 18 year old woman on her thigh?\"\nMW: He's in middle school. He should be allowed to touch her like that. It's just her thigh! Besides, he should learn how to flirt with girls. \nI get up and go to my room to cry. One good thing Margaret White told me was to always defend myself against things like innapropriate touches. Especcially when I don't want it. My brother is not my husband. And he never will be. \nOther things he does is kiss me on my shoulders and hug me where his hand is too close to my chest. I always pull away and I try to play it off cool. I tell him \"Dude. I don't like that. Please stop.\" His respose: \"But I only wanted a kiss and a hug!!!\" I normally come back with a \"Yes. But you need to respect women and their space. I did not invite you to hug or kiss me. Especcially in the way you did.\" He also acts all suductive like \"Hey baby. I know you like this.\" and he'd rub my arm or leg. I hate it and end up crying about it to myself or JYDad or JYSister. He does this a lot and whenever I tell Margaret White, she does nothing. JustYesDad told him not to do that to me, but I suspect Margaret White is telling him it's ok. \nI don't think they know how much trouble I can get into with the law if PreJustNoBrother told people he does this.\nI would get in trouble with Margaret White. I do tell JustYesDad first. It usually results in an argument between them. I'm tired of being the primary subject of arguments and I'm tired of PreJustNoBrother doing this to me.

I wish I didn\u2019t have this much shit to process via Reddit but here we are. On mobile. Please don\u2019t use my post outside of Reddit. I did not plan this but the baby shower happened exactly one year ago today! Lol\nI have posted about my JNMIL and my JNFIL & JNSMIL. Now I can talk about the baby shower. As usual, I\u2019m a \u201cdetails\u201d person so this is hella long. This also might be confusing because I go back and fourth talking about all the in-laws. \nI didn\u2019t originally want a baby shower due to DF\u2019s family starting drama. My mom convinced me to not let his family ruin a special day for us so I agreed to a baby shower. My conditions to letting her throw me one was that it be coed and it be kept intimate and small with only closest family/friends. \nMy mom was super respectful. She let me pick the theme and always asked for my opinion if there was something she wasn\u2019t sure about. She didn\u2019t want this to be about her or uncomfortable for me or DF. \nMIL on the other hand made this a super miserable experience leading up to the event. \nMy mom asked her for help putting together some decorations. My MIL decided that this wasn\u2019t enough. She went overboard (no one asked her to do more than what was expected) and we didn\u2019t realize she did until like maybe a week beforehand, which I\u2019ll get to. She picked fights with my mom and cried to everyone when she wasn\u2019t getting her way. \nShe was simply not listening to anyone. She was planning a shower for HER. She tried to include something that would have most definitely triggered a panic attack for me and she knew it would but didn\u2019t care because she wanted it. She was causing so much drama and that was causing a lot of stress for DF and I. My mom did her best to keep the drama away from us. \nMy SMIL and FIL also contributed to the drama. Before we even started planning the shower, we told EVERYONE that we were keeping the shower simple and small. We reminded FIL and SMIL more than once because they are huge show offs. \nOne time, SMIL started inviting people that I didn\u2019t know and DF met once FROM HER SIDE of the family, in front of me. I was seething.\nCloser to the day of the shower, my mom reaches out to SMIL to ask for their list of people they wanted to invite. My mom receives a SPREADSHEET of 50 fucking people. This was a week after we had reminded them we were not inviting a lot of people. Most of the people were people from her side. I was soooooo mad. We capped the guest list at 50 people but were not even aiming to invite that many people. I started getting anxious picturing that many people who I don\u2019t know at an event that is very personal to me with none of my friends or family there because we didn\u2019t have enough invites/food/drinks to accommodate that list and the people we wanted to invite. I started typing up an email to FIL and SMIL when DF (still in fog) asked me not to say anything. He will handle it. \nWe were discussing what to do and had decided to have my mom send us the list she was sent so we could decide who, out of that list, we wanted to invite. Unfortunately my mom had already sent out the invites. She said she didn\u2019t want to start drama. She bought more so that we could also invite our friends and my family.\nBUT WAIT! There\u2019s more...\nSMIL waited months before asking if my mom needed any help (she wanted all of us to kiss her ass and cater to her). So when she finally got the hint that she has to be an adult (she is in her 60\u2019s btw) and ask herself, my mom really had nothing for her to do. My mom asked them to bring beverages to placate them and their need to do something. But they were upset that is all they were asked to help with. So ultimately, SMIL really wasn\u2019t involved. And I didn\u2019t really mind...she had just recently treated me like garbage and expected to be an integral part of planning this special day, I think not. I knew she (and FIL) only wanted to help because she/they wanted the recognition. And what they did next proved me right...\nThe invitations had gone out and we had a peaceful break while everyone was receiving them. \nThis is where I introduce to you, my JN(step)SIL, our first FM. SSIL (who lived out of state so they went out of their way to call her just to talk shit) calls DF one day and starts going on about how SMIL and FIL talked to her about how they are upset that their names were not on OUR baby shower invitations. Uh, what? She says she would never think about leaving FIL\u2019s (her stepfather) name off of her wedding invitation and it was disrespectful that we did this to her mom. She said DF and I need to call them and apologize. DF JADED hard (which annoyed me) and gave her too much information as she is not involved whatsoever...and they ended the call. So again they decided to act passive aggressively instead of coming to us to let us know that they were upset and why. \nSide note: the only names that were listed were my mom\u2019s and MIL\u2019s as contacts to RSVP to, and their info was in tiny font at the bottom of the invitation. My dad, stepmom, birth father/his wife, birth mom, FIL & SMIL were all NOT listed on the invitation. Because they did not plan the shower so why would we have people call them to RSVP? Lol they were definitely not the only people left off of the invites. \nI don\u2019t know if it was the pregnancy hormones, the stress from the drama or the lack of sleep I was getting but I completely broke down. I just started bawling uncontrollably and then I got so worked up I started hyperventilating. DF was almost in tears seeing me like that. Once I calmed down I had decided I wanted to just cancel the shower. My DF was pissed his family was causing so much drama. I spent the rest of the day thinking it over and deciding whether or not to call my mom to cancel. I decided not to because of all the work and money she had already put into it. \nMy birthday was a few days before the shower and I had some family come in from out of town. So me, DF and my family that was able to make it all went out to dinner to celebrate my birthday. And if you guessed my in-laws were butthurt they were not invited to a dinner to celebrate me, you guessed right but I couldn\u2019t have cared less. They didn\u2019t/don\u2019t care about me so why would I invite them?\nMIL said to my mom a week before the shower while discussing the plans: \u201cThis is called planning.  I'm doing all the prep work and you are just showing up.  Appreciate that and just say thanks.\u201d My mom paid for the majority of the shower and was out of state. She definitely was doing a lot of prep just from afar and would be doing lots in a short amount of time when she arrived. MIL later bitched to us about how much time and money she \u201chad\u201d to spend.\nThe shower itself was okay. Nothing super crazy happened. Almost no one from SMIL\u2019s list came (to my relief). SMIL and FIL came. SMIL was fake nice and pouted the whole time. I was just happy to see family I hadn\u2019t seen in a while since I lived far from everyone. \nDF and I thanked everyone for coming and thanked my mom and MIL for putting the shower together. Epic CBF from SMIL as I looked right at her after we said this lol I know that was petty but I had to have a little fun at my shower!\nMy mom tried to salvage the day for us but at the end of this whole ordeal we were all emotionally exhausted and happy to get the damn thing over with.\n\n"}, {"title": "Expired Milk Never Fails At Being A Failure  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "79", "comments": "8", "content": "Obligatory mobile warning, and honestly don't care if you want to use this story. \nSo my JNMIL is called Expired Milk (if it isn't taken already) because she literally pulled the \"I am going to the store to get milk and never came back\" card when my DH was a child. She left DH with his step father to raise, which thankfully he did. I don't really know what she did during this time other than being a druggie and homeless, and calling my DH on his birthday every year being drunk.\nBut I guess eventually she got her act together and she and DH reconnected when he graduated high school. He ended up move to the state she lived in to be close to her, and everything was great right? Maybe she went through a mental crisis, or maybe she didn't have what it takes to be a mother, but a decent adult right? No wrong. Like any old jug of expired milk, she belongs in the garbage!\nShe didn't really want to reconnect with my DH, she just wanted to use him for money. She kept all his money and would give him what he needed. She eventually decided to move several states away with her dead best friend's husband (a lot of shady shit in that story) and DH moved to my state for our relationship, we started out as long distance, met through friends. We will be married 10 years this year, and I have only met this woman once! Thank god! Throughout our years she:\n\nNever came to our wedding or told us congratulations. \nOn holidays, she would turn her phone off so my husband couldn't get ahold of her, and then cry to DH that he didn't call and say \"Merry/Happy whatever\"\nConstantly played this phone game, where she would text or message my DH that he needed to call for something important, or she had bad news like she was dying (this woman has been dying for seven damn years!) And when my DH called, would berate him and tell him he was a bad son for not calling her more often.\nWould constantly visit relatives, but not us, even though we were on the way to her destination\nTried to give me parenting advice after our ODD was born.\nDrunk calls to DH and myself\nNever ever, not once told my oldest DD Happy Birthday, or Merry Christmas or even sent a card. She thinks she is grandmother of the year, but ODD doesn't even know who she is, and Expired Milk doesn't even know we had a second DD! \nAlways posting on the book of faces what a great mom she is, how she loves and thinks of her son and grandchild everyday\nWhen my stepfather past away unexpected, she sent me a FB message about how she knows how my mom feels because her husband has dementia and will die.... someday. I replied, at least you still have him, cherish the time. This bitch said \"Not for much longer\" That was 3 years ago, and I am pretty sure he is still alive. \n\nAnyways, I have been NC with her for about 7 years, and DH went from VVVLC to NC with her last year by just dropping the rope and not responding to her guilt ridden \"I'm dying call me\" texts. Which fortunately for us, it's easy because of distance and her sheer uninterest. However DHs birthday was last week, and nothing from her. No call, no text, not even a FB message. DHs stepdad at least sent a text. (The one who raised him, not the one Expired Milk is married to now)\nI am grateful she isn't bothering my DH, but at the same time it's like, how shitty of a mother can you really be? I know he was disappointed a little, not that he wanted to hear from her but just solidifying the fact she really doesn't care. At least she is the kinda trash that can take itself out.\n\n"}, {"title": "Updates on Outlaw and going VLC  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "109", "comments": "4", "content": "FDH moved over a few months ago and changed jobs.

(self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "317", "comments": "59", "content": "I'm not going to be marking this as a success today or any time soon because DH and I are just starting the marriage counseling, but after our first week and our first meeting over the weekend, we both feel like we'll be able to make some progress as long as we both stay open and respect each other's feelings. I'm not sure how we'll be able to gauge progress with Wreck-It Rose and her bullshit though, because, you know, not seeing her. (Although not having to deal with her next weekend for Mother's Day is definitely a score!)\nSo we both sat down with our counselor for the first time via video chat. It was only an initial meeting, but at the end of the meeting, after hearing both sides of our issue (our issue being WIR), she said it sounds like WIR is \"strong-willed\" and \"overbearing.\" She did ask me if I felt like I was maybe a little hypersensitive to WIR and if I was letting my mind make her every move into a personal attack. I told her absolutely. I said that when I first started feeling like WIR was trying to cause problems, I tried to accommodate her and let things roll off my back, but then when I was being nitpicked for everything down to how I sat on the couch and none of my concerns about her were even addressed, then her boundary stomping and trying to take over aspects of my life and her starting fights over our wedding pictures and the whole thing with her never being able to take \"no\" for an answer and either pushing us until we change our minds or plowing forward as if we said yes, I felt like years of what I feel to be abuse from her have reverberated into even the most microscopic level. I said that, while DH has admittedly made a lot of progress as far as boundaries and changing their dynamic on his end, the years of having to sit quietly and take her abuse while not having my own needs heard, make me feel like I need to let loose about EVERYTHING she does that bothers me so that SOMETHING will stick. The therapist gave us some homework, which was for me to breathe slowly and relax my body when WIR is brought up in conversation because \"a calm body cannot harbor anxiety,\" and after our call, I asked DH how his conversation with WIR earlier in the morning went. He told me about some of what they talked about, fully knowing that I was trying to use the opportunity to practice my homework. Plus, it gave me an opportunity to hear about the things going on in his family, namely the family members of his I love (which is almost all of them) and JNSIL, who has been making lots of bad decisions in the face of the state of the world right now.\nDH will be getting a homework assignment of his own next week (she's starting us off slowly, which I appreciate), and we were given a group assignment as well. The assignment is: we each write a letter outlining our ideal future that includes WIR. I don't want DH to have to cut off his mother (that is until she does something extreme, like threatening me or one of our future kids or something like that, but I'd like to get him to a point where he can handle her himself and will make that decision himself if--god forbid--things come to that) but I also want her in my life as little as possible. If I was writing this six months ago, maybe I would feel differently, but I still have not heard a single word from her regarding me losing two family members in a car accident four months ago, and that was the final straw for me. If you can't even say to your son who is standing right next to you and who is currently texting his wife about her dead family members, \"Tell her I'm sorry for her loss,\" then that wife doesn't owe you a relationship.\nSo far, I'm thinking my letter should say that DH can have whatever relationship he wants with her as long as he stands up for me when she starts her bullshit, he shuts her down when she refuses to take no for an answer and will instill consequences if she plows through of causes damage to someone somehow (I.e., pretending like hearing about my losses was a tabloid headline she doesn't care about), and sets boundaries of his own, such as telling her to mind her own business when she gets nosy about things in his life and telling her somehow to fuck off when she makes fun of him or chastises him for the decisions he makes for us or himself. I'm still working on the part of the letter addressing my future relationship with WIR, but I'm feeling a lot of \"my house, my kids, my marriage, my rules, and your opinion is not wanted\" with a little bit of \"if my rules or boundaries are pushed or stomped, she get consequences and has to apologize and adjust her behavior.\" I feel like after the aforementioned ignored loss, whatever positive relationship WIR and I could have had is a fantasy that will never be realized. She told me and DH loud and clear how little fucks she has to give about me, and I have absolutely no willpower left in me to have a relationship with her. It's not vindictive, it's not petty, it's not hatred. I just don't have the capacity to try to make a relationship with someone who has hit me over the head with a sledgehammer that says \"I wouldn't even give you kindness if your family died.\" I'll be civil with her as long as she's civil with me, and that's about all I can muster.\nI'm marking this as NAW because I want to write my letter with as little outside input as possible. This is all about what I want in my specific relationship with WIR and DH. However, if anyone had a similar assignment from a therapist, whether it was about their MIL/Mom or someone else, I'd like to hear your stories and how things went with it.\nI also wanted to add that DH really likes our therapist and feels like things will go well with her. That's a HUGE plus, since, thanks to WIR, he's incredibly closed off and doesn't let a lot of people in. And the fact she isn't telling me I need to get over it because FaMiLy and is helping me to address my stress levels first, it feels amazing and for the first time I really feel heard in my cries for help about WIR.\nEdited to add: I'm getting a few comments saying that the therapist giving me an exercise to deal with WIR being brought up in conversation is her telling me that I need to just get over my feelings or repress them, and that I'm not overreacting to WIR and her antics. I'd like to address these.\nFirst, before we had our meeting with the therapist, we were asked to use the chat function of the website to express our feelings on why we were in therapy. DH made a post after I did, and he included some goals for therapy. I made another post that included my goals, one of which was to be able to slowly get better at handling my emotions about WIR. I want to be able to hear her name or have a conversation about her without immediately having my hair stand on end and my body tense up. I feel like my physical and mental health will benefit greatly if I can relax and not give her the power of getting under my skin just at the mention of her name. I asked for this. This is not the therapist repressing my feelings. This is her helping me to achieve my goals for multiple aspects of my own health.\nSecond, I was never accused of overreacting. She asked me if I was a little hypersensitive. As far as either of us understood, she did not say I was overreacting, but was pointing out--and I agreed with her totally--that I react too often, and that I take everything as a planned attack and not what a lot of it most likely is, which is her plowing through and not caring how we are effected by her actions. I told the therapist that I absolutely feel like I'm hypersensitive to WIR, and I told her that I feel like I've been WIR's punching bag for so many years without feeling like I can rely on DH to stop her. I told her I feel like my reaction to suppressing my abuse seemed normal as far as victims of this kind of abuse go, and she seems to agree. The therapist said WIR sounded incredibly overbearing and self-centered with not much empathy, and that this kind of relationship is toxic (I was so glad to hear her use \"toxic\" to describe this behavior!). Her goal is to loosen WIR's grip on us and help us work together to have a healthy relationship with each other and as healthy of one that we can get out of WIR. Since we can't change her, that will revolve around our reactions to her.\nAnd to the person who said that DH \"just needs to be a good husband,\" that is literally the goal here, but it needs to be worked towards. You saying that was not helpful.\nEdited to add some detail.\n\n"}, {"title": "I hate the selfies jnmil sends to SO  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": 0, "comments": "8", "content": "My husband is low contact with his mother right now but she still sends him selfies where she thinks she\u2019s hot. \nShe thinks she is stop traffic beautiful and thinks that anyone who looks at her is into her.

We're in the middle of a pandemic, she shouldn't even be seeing her friends.\n\n"}, {"title": "The War Is Over  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "840", "comments": "47", "content": "I had to delete my last post.  There was a breach of one of my online profiles.  Turns out it was the book of faces but had to do some damage control before I knew.\nMy JNM earned her name and will henceforth be known as Plague Granny.\nIn my last post I ranted about how she went up to my sister's place in another city despite my province's prohibition on unnecessary travel.  She knew I was off work for two weeks because of her travel.  Well, I fucked myself over.  I made a post on FB that was calling out people like her.  In a comment I called her something I had only previously called her in my head.  My FB is private and not searchable to non-friends and everything is set to private/friends only.  My mother and sister are not on my friends list.  But somehow they got ahold of the post.  I've only traced it back to one of my sister's RL friends who is not a friend of mine either.  So basically PG went nuclear up at my sister's.\nWhen she got home the next week she gave me a deadline to be out of \"her\" house.  She gave me until May 1 to move.  So for the next couple weeks I searched for a place in the town I work in.  I also started applying for jobs with other firms.  I did find a place in the town I work in that would have required a raise to afford (still the cheapest place I could find).  I asked my boss for a raise (haven't had once since I started 3 years ago despite upgrading my education - 1/2 way to my CPA designation now).  He hemmed and hawed but agreed to a $4000 raise that would be revocable if he didn't think I earned it.\nWell, last week I had an interview in the city I live in.  I got an email offer on Monday which would include a $9000 raise.  I've always been afraid of change when it comes to giving up my known situations even if they are uncomfortable.  But I decided to check out a place in town.  If it wasn't going to work I'd take the shithole near the current job and the shitty raise.\nBut, MY GOD, this place was incredible.  New construction, all utilities including cable and internet included.  Walk out basement suite with 1 bed/bath + den, 1200 sq.ft.  Only $300 more than the shit hole where I would have a tiny bedroom/bathroom and grudging access to the common kitchen (which she wasn't apparently going to let me access originally).  \nSo of course I took the job and the apartment!  \nThe only catch is that the apartment is not going to be ready until May 30th and the job starts June 15th.\nDad, who until now has stayed out of this last spat, was able to negotiate the move out deadline until June 1.\nSo in 4 weeks, I will be out!  As soon as I made the decision it was like all my stress was steam being released out of a pressure cooker.  I haven't felt this good mentally in years!\nPS:  Apparently I was not the only person who called the tip line/cops on PG being out visiting.  One of my sister's neighbors must not have appreciated seeing a non-resident vehicle coming and going.   Because PG got a call from the RCMP about her travels.  Somehow, one of the towns she works in also found out.  They called her and told her not to bother with her usual weekly trip.  So that would have contributed her pissiness on top of my post.\nPPS:  She made a third trip to my sister's and I am currently wondering why she hasn't gone again since she's on such minimal hours.\n\n"}, {"title": "MIL comes over to say hi and see the grandkids... right after attending a quarantine protest.

But in the last few years, she\u2019s gotten involved in politics and has increasingly become more polarized,  constantly watching Fox News and subscribing to many of the latest conspiracy theories. She doesn\u2019t believe Covid-19 is all that bad, it\u2019s basically the flu, government is the devil, etc etc. Whatever. Those are her beliefs and, although I completely disagree with her, she can believe whatever she wants, I don\u2019t care it doesn\u2019t bother me. \nThe yesterday afternoon, she and my SIL pull into the driveway; they stay in their vehicle and say they just want to chat and see the kids. The kids come out and get and receive hugs. This has never been a problem before, as MIL has always practiced basic social distancing before: she drops gifts off on our porch for the kids to pick up rather than coming in the house, she wears her mask when she goes to the store, etc. (Not to mention, when my late FIL was going thru chemotherapy many years ago, both MIL and SIL took care of him, so they know about the whole \u201cprotect other people\u2019s immune systems\u201d thing.) \nWhile she was visiting, MIL said she had only one request for her Mother\u2019s Day/birthday gift (her bday is right around Mother\u2019s Day): she wanted her kids and grandkids to come have lunch at her place on the patio. Okay, not an unreasonable request, if we take the proper precautions; we tell her we\u2019ll think about it. \nAbout an hour after they left, we\u2019re chatting w/SIL\u2019s husband on the phone. Turns out MIL & SIL had gone to a Freedom Protest at the state capital with a few hundred other people earlier that day, and posted pics of themselves with other protesters, bearing huge happy smiles with nary a glove or mask in sight. And then right after that, knowing damn good and well that we take this pandemic seriously, they come to OUR HOUSE and hug and kiss on OUR KIDS wearing the exact same damn clothes they wore while they were hang out with and hugging god-knows-how-many people. Oh, and they gave Kid2 a small American flag (handled by who-knows-how-many people) and a TMNT mask, which SIL briefly put on her face right before giving it to Kid2. \nMy husband and I are FURIOUS, him more so than I. She damn well knows better. And this was such an unexpected sucker-punch breach of trust, he\u2019s absolutely reeling. We\u2019re talking about the best way to let her know that the kids are now NC for quite awhile, not to mention that the whole \u201cMother\u2019s Day/birthday lunch\u201d is NOT fucking happening (probably for a few years, with the way we\u2019re feeling right now.) \nAaaaanyway, so that\u2019s where we are.

I do not give permission for this story to be shared elsewhere. \nSo before I dive into things, there\u2019s a little bit of backstory here. Both my fianc\u00e9 and I growing up had fathers with an alcohol problem. We\u2019ve both dealt with emotional/physical abuse as a result of it. We\u2019re both very well aware that addiction runs in both of our families and if we are going through a tough time, we make sure to talk to someone and get help instead of turning to a substance. Our experiences growing up with addiction have made us want to ensure we don\u2019t end up like that. \nDuring the quarantine, there has been a lot more downtime and we\u2019ve been drinking a little more than normal (like many other people during this time). We don\u2019t drink every day and we\u2019re not chugging bottles. My fianc\u00e9 was talking to his mom a few weeks back and she was asking of our plans for the evening. He told her we were going to the grocery store for a few supplies and to replenish the vodka. She grew very concerned and point blank started accusing him of having an alcohol problem and went on a whole lecture about how she was concerned he was going to turn into his dad. He ended that conversation after that. She brought it up again a few more times after that and is now fully convinced he\u2019s an alcoholic. \nDuring the quarantine, his JustYes aunt, who lives in the suburbs has been kind enough to allow us to bring our dogs over to her backyard once in awhile to let them run around since all the dog parks are closed. We don\u2019t go inside at all; she usually stands out on our back deck and talks to us from above, and we always have masks on, and the doggos are happy. FMIL catches wind of this happening and decides that she wants us to bring the dogs to her yard next time (despite her telling people not to come by her house at all during all this craziness). \nSo fast forward to yesterday. We go over there with our dogs and I just have a gut feeling this visit is gonna be a shitshow. The second we get there, FMIL immediately gives my fianc\u00e9 a laundry list of chores of him to do. He obliges because his mom is a narcissist that will guilt trip him and make him feel like shit He\u2019s not around at all for the whole visit. FMIL decides to use this one on one time in the yard to interrogate me about her son. She once again brought up that she\u2019s worried he has a drinking problem. That alone pissed me off, but what she said next made me want to officially go VLC with her. She had the fucking nerve to ask me \u201cwhat kind of drunk he was\u201d, trying to suggest he\u2018s aggressive like his dad was. \nI had zero energy to deal with her bullshit or to argue with her.  I got up, risked myself getting the corona just to go into the house to get my fianc\u00e9 and tell him I was packing up the dogs and that we were leaving. I told him that she\u2019s starting on her bullshit again and I can\u2019t deal with it. All of a sudden, FMIL comes storming up the stairs and my fianc\u00e9 really laid it into her and we left not long after that. Before we left, she came back to him and gave him a hug (which also is a big no no during this time) and said she was sorry and tried to make an excuse for it. \nI refuse to go back over to her house or to willingly interact with her. I have point blank told my fianc\u00e9 this and he is supportive and understand. He himself doesn\u2019t even feel comfortable going over there anymore either. My fianc\u00e9 is not his father. He\u2019s the farthest thing from aggressive and wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. And most of all, he is most definitely NOT an alcoholic. Having grown up with an alcoholic father, I know the classic signs/behaviors and he does not present any of them. \nUnfortunately, his family culture also is going to make this difficult to go VLC (they\u2019re the kind of folks that live by the whole \u201cfamily is family\u201d mantra and just brush all the toxicity in their family under the rug and put on this charade that they\u2019re all perfect and close and lovey dovey). As it is, I already don\u2019t have a good relationship with FMIL (because of bullshit like this) and his family gives me a lot grief for it.\n\n"}, {"title": "DH finally heard me! Success!

Not gonna lie, I got overwhelmed and started crying bc it had taken a lot for me to open up to him about it since typically he is defensive about any subject pertaining to his mother.

Which is something I had trouble with doing in the past because I didn't feel I had his support to do so! \nSome examples of her behavior in the past include:\nAfter our baby was born, LO had colic, so I dealt with months of continuous crying... One day LO was crying while I was trying to wash dishes, so I went and picked LO up to sooth... MIL stated, \"how would you ever make it on your own??\" Like I should be grateful DH hadn't made the move yet.\nMIL knows we will be moving soon and recently asked me \"are you sure you'll be able to handle being a SAHM??\" Uhhh of course! That's all I've ever wanted? Without her presence of course. \nShe continuously tails behind me whether I'm cooking or cleaning to \"fix\" things to her liking. Ughhh that's frustrating. Definitely won't be allowed in my new kitchen!\nHad a pity party crying and everything! to DH bc we didn't bring wood in or wash dishes at 9 at night and instead waited until the morning and tried to suggest that I give our LO too much fast food. All at the same time! Oooh I was mad, our LO does eat the occasional FF, but eats PLENTY of other healthy things like bananas and oranges. I don't think her deep fried potatoes and mushrooms are too far from fast food anyways. But whatever she calls \"healthy\" eye roll\nShe tried to accuse me of stealing ear rings when my ears aren't even pierced, I told DH, he confronted her about it, and she made up a BS lie about how \"the ghost\" must have taken them and she wasn't accusing me I just \"misunderstood\" her... Yeah, okay. \nShe enters our room every time we leave, I know this bc I've had to run back in plenty of times to catch her snooping through everything. But her house, she can do as she pleases right? Ugh, when we get our place, she better make herself comfortable in the living room! That's if I even decide to open the door. Lol. \nOver all, DH finally heard me! These things have frustrated me in the past, but now that he's giving me the okay, I'll be calling her out on her behavior!

JNGMIL tried to send her flying monkeys (JNAIL) and one of DH cousins and at one point QC but all were shut down quick by DH and or blocked. \nBaby is due in the next few days I have my surgery scheduled and Dh called from work asking if there is anything left on the registry. That morning I had bought every single thing we had left up on there except diapers and wipes as we have a good supply ready and I can get more later. I asked why since only my mom and grandparents had even bothered to look at it and between them and DH and I we spent $1200 and got everything on there. \nApparently Queen Complex called asking what the registry is under (me AND DH names and our shared last name) like it\u2019s not hard to find at all plus I sent the link to JYFIL and I know she knows this since JYFIL said they liked some things on there months ago. She was all upset she wasn\u2019t able to buy anything for DS off of our registry (this lady never bothered buying anything I\u2019ve ever suggested for DD for any bdays holidays or even her baby shower she got what SHE wanted my daughter to have so in the past She\u2019s gotten so many non age approved gifts they are still in storage or donated) \nDH said FIL has been waiting for QC to I pick things out with him so he finally told QC he\u2019s ordering now and if she doesn\u2019t help pick or even look he will just say it\u2019s from him alone not her but they looked after everything was bought. So Dh asked if I could add a few things for them. This was hard since I had taken so long to be very detailed and make lists of what we need of everything and in what sizes and am very organized so I already got anything except diapers. \nBut I added a couple clothes and things that said \u201cMamas boy\u201d like books about sons loving their Mom and added a car seat cover that said \u201cdo NOT touch your germs are to big for me thank you\u201d and then a few little toys \nI laughed so hard to myself adding the stuff as I\u2019m sure the message will get across. \nQueen Complex works in the ER and said her blood was tested and she has tested that she has the anti body\u2019s for COVID and is immune to it now and says she doesn\u2019t have to wait two weeks to see DS. \nThis pertains to our new rules when he\u2019s born. No one even per hospital rules is allowed to visit the hospital only DH and I. After we get home no visitors what so ever for two weeks. Then for the  two weeks after that people can visit but CAN NOT hold him only DH and I and if they have been around anyone sick they still can not visit. I will also be checking temps before they walk in the door and 30 min visits only. Idc he\u2019s a new born and I\u2019m a stressed out mama. But DH told her straight up the rules still apply to her even if she supposedly is immune. \nSo let\u2019s see how she feels about the gifts I added for her since she feels so left out I doubt she would ever get him anything that says he\u2019s Mamas boy or no touching I just added them for a good laugh to myself. I added 1-2 other things that I\u2019m sure she would get instead. \nFeeling better and a lot happier being away from the drama and now even able to get a small laugh at all of it.\n\n"}, {"title": "\u2018It\u2019s such a shame that you are going back to work\u2019  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "1541", "comments": "83", "content": "My MIL seems to have a real problem with working mothers.

She called my oldest stupid at her first birthday party because she could only say 7 word. She gave me a lecture about switching her to skim milk because the whole milk was going to her thighs and she doesn't want fat grandchildren. She also told my daughter to her face at 18 months that if she wasn't happier and sweeter soon she wouldn't love her anymore. \nNow, my oldest is 2 and the perfect grandchild to her. My 7 month old on the other hand isn't good enough. She is constantly being compared to her cousin (10 months) and isn't worth their time. \nI took my daughter's to my BIL house  because the family was going shooting and the kids were going to play together. My husband stayed back to work on the yard. From the minute I walked in, she started criticizing my LO (7 months old). \nShe was cranky so I said she didn't feel good. MIL - \"That's not an excuse when she's always like that\"\nShe cried when her cousin head butted her. MIL - \"She clearly has issues being around other kids\"\nShe didn't smile when MIL got in her face MIL - \"She doesn't know how to laugh or smile\"\nIt went on like this for 2 hours with other family members chiming in. \"Cousin does nothing but smile but LO doesn't know how!\" \"You guys claim she smiles and laughs but you must drug her when you leave the house because she has 0 personality\" \"Aren't you concerned she isn't entertaining?\" \"Look how perfect cousin is unlike LO\" \nNo one engaged her more than once. When they tried to play with her and she didn't instantly laugh, they scoffed at her and said \"you're too serious/no fun\". MIL held her for a few minutes and then claimed it hurt her back to hold her. She then picked up cousin and was just fine holding him. When I was holding her and she started bouncing and getting happy, they all ignored her. When she started to fuss, MIL had to comment about \"how LO just doesn't know how to be happy\"  \nEventually, I said we needed to get home and left. I couldn't hear it anymore. I'm sorry my 7 month old doesn't entertain you. Maybe she just doesn't like you. (I regret not saying it)\nAnd I get that a baby having 0 interaction IS concerning. But my daughter is SO happy and smiley at home and day care. She laughs all the time. She chatters away and tries to copy what her sister does.  She loves to play. When we are out somewhere, she quiets down and watches everything. \nCompared to some stories on here, I don't know if she's a true JNMIL because she does help us out a lot and loves everyone. My husband tells me \"this is just how his family is\". I just don't know if I can continue to bring my kids around people that are so negative.\nEDIT: I want to address a lot I've been told/asked \n1) After each issue I mentioned, I put contact on hold with his family and my husband essentially told them to knock it off.  They are better for  awhile and then something happens again. Once I left, I told my husband it would be a long time before we saw them again. \n2) I was abused as a child. When I am in these situations, I shut down completely. Yes I want to protect my children. I hate myself for putting them in the position. Once they start getting into saying things, I cannot move or speak. It reduces me back to a fearful child who is unable to get away for fear of what would happen. I know it is an issue. I am in therapy and work really hard. Yes there is something wrong with me as some have asked and I'm working through it.

Now if we do aggravate her or she is uncomfortable and we notice we do give her some space, a minute or two to herself so she doesn't feel threatened. We back off give her room and try to give her as many escape routes as possible.This has almost never failed till today. \nNow MIL has 2 small \"toy breeds\" (a Yorkie and a Maltese mix) that she \"cares\" for but she does some questionable care for them. Her at home grooming it pretty rough around the face and especially on the ears.  Outside of grooming shell just pick them up whenever with one hand,or be all up in there face. If they are near her when she wants them she will pull them to her. This behavior with these small toy breeds is something DH,FIL,and I are uncomfortable with but she really doesn't listen much. FIL calls it out often but he hasn't had much luck getting her to change her ways.\nFIL,worked for a kennel registered breeder for a period of time. His family was in the business of breeding dogs(I belive they were boxers,I don't know the actual name but the coat is similar in length and texture). So he is aware of how some actions can lead to bad things,and has dealt with multiple problems with some of the puppies and dogs. Our family vet is aware of his family's business and what he has done and occasionally they will have FIL fix a issue(ingrown nail,a bad tooth,occasionally a stitch that wasn't full removed).\nSo,I have posted on here before and well same lady. We were all chill but...it clearly didn't last. So DH and I have a 5 year old mainecoon mix.  Recently I noticed her lickng and bitting at a chunk of fur on her lower belly. I groomed down what I could of her fur before I reached the knot. This tiny clump of fire wrapped in a half in-half out out stitch. The skin around it was irritated and me not knowing what a possible infection would look like I told her vet and she is being seen tomorrow to have it removed. Now I told MIL about my recently discovery and she immediately tries to pick her up and force her on her back to see where it is and how bad it is. My cat is clearly un comfortable. I try to separate her and my cat but she pulls my cat closer,being now within an inch of my cats face. This is something we don't try to let happen with her.  MiL tried to find it but pulling at her fur and gets hissed at. I was not having it so I removed her arms off my cat and requested we leave her alone. We go into the dinning room and MIL slightly angered,by my actions towards her i can only guess suggests, suggests in front of FIL and DH that we don't need to pay for the vet bill,we can have FIL just cut it out. DH and I said no thank you,MIL proceed to remind us he has had to do it before on dogs. I kindly sighed and responded \"thank you but I don't think that is the safest option. She has fur entangled into the stich and we can't really see if its infected or not. The vet ask that we isolate her to a room and watch her to make sure she doesn't pull it out on her own\". MIL WAS ENRAGED BY THIS. She looked at FIL in disbelief.  I couldn't tell weather she was mad at me for separating her from my cat or for denying her offer of help.. FIL,being the most sane person and the most reasonable out of DH's parents. Nodded as he replied \"If the vet thinks it could possibly be infected its better if I don't mess with it\". DH trying to lighten the tension \"our poor baby is gonna have a bald spot tomorrow\" .it works for me,himself,and FIL but MIL was still mad. I returned into the room while DH and FIL discussed how the vet will possibly handle the situation. Now this conversation last a good 5 to 7 minutes so I figured mabye my cat would be cooled down and would be fine if I walked in and sat next to her. This was not the case. I was hissed at for going near her. She was laying on the foot of the bed and was instantly hissing and sat up and held up a paw. I got pawed at with ears back fully. I took this as a sign to just leave her alone for alittle bit longer. I walked out and told the IL's that the vet ask we restrain from touching her belly,picking her up,and letting her do heavy activity till the stitches are removed. MIL,just gave a eye roll,and went to go do who knows what I left the room. Me and DH have never seen our cat act like this. We talked to FIl about MIL actions and how she ignored my cats signs of being uncomfortable and I was uncomfortable with how she was handling my cat like she does her dogs. He wasn't surprised by  her actions and treatment of my cat. He had a guilty look but couldn't seem to come up with words.  None of us can understand how she finds her actions with her \"pets\" okay and normal.  She swears everyone does this and nothing she does is wrong but logic says otherwise.\n\n"}, {"title": "Got told my parenting skills will be overridden since this will be my first child and she knows how to raise children better?  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "494", "comments": "172", "content": "Tl;Dr : read the title.\nThis is not my MIL, but my grandmother. I didnt know where else to post this for advice.\nI'm a little over 3 months pregnant with my first child. My grandmother basically raised me and the oldest of my two little brothers. Since I've made the announcement, her behavior has gotten absolutely ridiculous.\nFirst incident: When I announced the pregnancy to her, she asked me to take her off speaker phone (as my father, brother, and FDH were all in the room anxiously waiting for her reaction) and proceeded to make me cry by being so horrible. She told me to not get it in my head that she is excited because she was very upset and disappointed that I had decided to ruin my life by having a child and that I will now be permanently tied to my FDH. HER PLANS for me were for me to re-enlist in the national guard (She pressured me into enlisting at 17. Worst mistake of my life. I loved the guard and the people in it, but she and everyone now hold that over my head) and for me to find a nice christian man (not FDH) to settle down with around my thirties to then have children with. Hours after this happened, she asked if she could tell her two friends so they could gossip about how my life is now over. I went home and cried myself to sleep that night.\nSecond incident: a name I liked for a girl was Morticia Rose. Im a HUGE Addams Family fan. She yelled at me for having it written in my book as a suggestion and said \"If you ever named your baby gurl that, I will only call her Mortie just because you had the audacity to give her such a terrible name. I would never let you forget that.\" And then made fun of the boys names i had written down.\nThird incident: I have BARELY started showing yet, I honestly look like I just had a good lunch. I wear really baggy clothes anyways, so you can't see my stomach no matter what I wear. She always rubs my belly (and I have a little bit of fat) and says \"rub the baby!\" And does it repeatedly when i smack her hand away because it makes me uncomfortable, she never asks permission, she didnt put it there, and I'm not even showing at all. Its not like you can feel the baby. She gets offended when I tell her to stop because \"she raised me and has every right to rub my belly and do whatever she wants\"\nFourth incident: She says I have no parenting skills and that shes going to end up raising another child, she tells this to everyone. I was the only one out of four kids she raised that came out semi okay because I spent every waking moment with my Great grandfather and not her. She has told me that she will dress and teach my child how she feels like because her parenting skills are much better than mine will be because a life with FDH and I will be \"evil and demon filled\" because we listen to rock music and like horror movies. I even caught her talking to her mother on the phone saying how once they force me to take all the left over junk that they claim is mine (but isn't) then they'll just have to take my baby and raise it because i wont have the room for anything the baby needs.\nI could keep going, but I would be going on for DAYS. Is this me being pregnant and hormonal? Shes never acted this way about a child or towards me. Is this normal? What should I do? Every time I put my foot down about something, she just pretends nothing happened for a couple days and goes right back to the same behavior.\n\n"}, {"title": "last bit of hope before I leave the man I was planning on spending my life with...

We have been through some hard trials, and have always come out stronger. We support each other, encourage each other, and just genuinely want the best for one another. But we also call each other out when we need it, and aren\u2019t afraid to tell each other when we\u2019re acting out of character. And we are always looking to better ourselves. We are best friends, and anything I find myself doing in the world I always think how much better it would be if he were there with me. Sounds perfect right?

Mother. \nLet\u2019s set aside the fact that she hates me, specifically because I don\u2019t follow the same religion as her. She considers me to be \u2018not a real Christian\u2019, although her son has no connection with a higher power because of the opinions she has forced on him. But stay with me reddit readers, don\u2019t let that upset you, because trust me I also felt left out that I wasn\u2019t included when God opened the clouds and told her that she had the right to judge and condemned people. Gosh she has all the fun ;) Anyway jokes aside, she hateful. She has told him to leave me, has spread lies about me to his family, and friends of the family. Has been caught looking through my all of my social media, and when confronted flat out lied. She is invasive, and doesn\u2019t respect a single boundary I have set after being crushed by her hateful ways. Oh I should add, while she was doing all of these high school bully like things, she was being super fake and nice to my face. Making catty little comments that I didn\u2019t realize were rude until after the fact. And to top it all off, after having a huge blow out, and her true feelings finally coming out, I tried to forgive. I attempted to take small steps in order to make my boyfriends life better, because I completely recognize how hard this is for him. But just as I think things are getting better, I find out that because we set boundaries for her and our relationship, she has now taken it upon herself to ask his friends about our life. And I think it was an eye opening experience that she will never respect me, or our relationship. \nWe have recently started talking about marriage, I love him, with my whole heart, I truly love him. But now that this has come out, and I\u2019ve realized she doesn\u2019t respect our privacy or boundaries, I just don\u2019t know how I can agree to sign up for disrespect for the rest of my life. She would literally be the definition of \u2018Monster In Law\u2019. And I just need real advice, on how to help her understand what\u2019s she\u2019s doing. Does she want her son to hurt? People aren\u2019t really that hateful are they? Someone, anyone, please just give me a little hope that it gets better.

Please excuse formatting and other mistakes I\u2019m a first time poster here. JNM has been married twice, first husband had a daughter my JYsis, second husband my father two kids GC brother and me. \nMy JYSis was given to her father to raise while my JNM married my father. After she divorced my JYdad I lived with her but eventually was given to my father to raise and my JYDad and very yes grandma raised me. \nI barely saw JNM growing up I remember a few times she dropped off the GC but she always drove away without seeing me. Yes she raised the GC not me or my sis.  I tried living with her when I was a teen but she was cold and I spent a lot of time next door at my JYGM house.  I eventually move in with JYGM and she passed away when I was 17.\nI had a son when I was 18 and a daughter when I was 24. I saw right away they were treated differently by my JNM and her family, I shut that down or so I thought. What I didn\u2019t know is when my son was with her he was given everything he wanted and allowed to do what he wanted. Eventually she was telling him I was a bad mother.\nI held my children accountable for there mistakes, never cruelly mostly toy jail or taking away electronics as consequences. They had responsibilities such as small chores, I taught them how to use a microwave or stove for cooking things like noodles or canned goods. My son started to pull away from family spending all his time in his room and having violent outbursts.\nMy son has a mood disorder and needs meds which he wasn\u2019t taking. He ran away to a friends house at 17 years old claiming abuse. No one laid a hand on him, called him names or talked down to him. JNM would visit him but not make the 20 min drive from where he was to our house to see me or my daughter.\nAll this has led to NC, my son refuses to talk me his dad or his sis. JNM is right there to pick up his mess when he\u2019s done wrong, he isn\u2019t responsible for his actions and is given whatever he wants or needs. I haven\u2019t spoke to JNM or my son in three years. JNM treats the boys like kings and the girls like trash. \nFor 37 years I chased after my JNM to love me, been to therapy a lot too. During a family therapy session she walked out because my therapist asked why she abandoned and neglected me. Mother walked out stating she doesn\u2019t have to take this. \nI miss my son terribly but not JNM side of the family. These things have been on my mind a lot recently and I thought I\u2019d get it all out.  I\u2019ve been searching social media for my son and I can\u2019t call my JNM because she won\u2019t answer, honestly I don\u2019t know her phone number anymore. I\u2019m disabled with chronic pain and that put a little extra chores with my kids on my bad days I struggled but was still a mom and did a majority of it. This is a reason JNM says I\u2019m a bad mom because I couldn\u2019t always get out with them and says my son did everything. \nSorry it\u2019s a little all over the place.\n\n"}, {"title": "I went NC - it broke my heart  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "89", "comments": "12", "content": "Don't put this on your crap blog. The thing editors appreciate more than a story, is source consent.\nContext for my hellbeast mum is in the bot.\nI went NC with her after work on Friday. I'd been thinking about it ages, and she kind of forced me to do it for a few reasons.\nReason the first: She has sprung a trip on us over Easter. She called and said and she had taken a bunch of time off over Easter and she was coming down. She hadn't considered that maybe my D(ear)H might have wanted to travel for Easter? Turns out that Covid happened and Australia shut down a bunch of borders. I planned on doing it then, but I don't think I was prepared for it then.\nReason the second: I'd been talking to my therapist about my mother having a drunken tantrum about grandmother's death. She helped herself to my husband's bar, got blind drunk and was listening to sad music in a dark room. I asked her to apologise to my husband about helping herself to the bar and she flew off the handle. I told my husband about this and he said, \"Do you remember her telling me to leave you?\" Apparently I had repressed the memory of her crying about being an awful mother and telling my DH to leave me because I would turn into her.\nReason the third: Stories from my wedding and her behaviour keep popping up, and the final straw came from my best friend. Her partner came over from Texas to see her and was in town for our wedding. My mother, in a drunken state, was berating him for being American, being Texan, having guns, and voting for Trump (he didn't, and he's a responsible gun owner). I apologised for my mum's behaviour at my wedding to my best friend and I realised that this isn't something I should do.\nI spoke to my therapist, who reassured me that whatever I did, it would be a decision made from a rational place, as well as a place of protection.\nI wrote a script to keep myself on task, I set a date and had my husband beside me. And I did it.\nAll she said was \"Very well, goodbye.\" It was cold.\nIt broke my heart. I don't believe she's a bad parent, I believe she had bad role models (her parents were shit) and a god awful tragedy (my dad dying when I was 4) that triggered everything.

BF and I live w MIL and her mom Ever since then my MIL has flown off the handle into a deep dark hole. She excessively spends money to where she\u2019s pawned some personal items of my boyfriends, hers, and passed FIL. Took months for her to get SOME items back. Last year in November I got my first car, and just recently I hit a deer and it\u2019s currently undriveable due to money issues. Since I haven\u2019t been driving my car I\u2019ve been forced to use hers to get where I need to go. Anytime I go somewhere, MIL or her mom asks me to pick up something from somewhere. MIL will wait DAYS until I go somewhere bf doesn\u2019t have license to tell me she needs me to pick up numerous things from certain stores. Lately it has gotten excessive & she never leaves the house unless she absolutely needs to (which is when I\u2019m not home or asleep). I do it willingly because I don\u2019t want to create tension since I live w her and use her car. I pay for gas when it\u2019s needed, I was going to start paying for oil changes but yanno, covid. \nAround a month or two ago she brought home a puppy. She didn\u2019t consult any of us besides her son (my bf) who was with her at the time. I\u2019m a little upset by that because none of us are mentally stable enough to take care of yet another dog (we already had 2). Shes let the puppy pee & poop all over the floor and then blames us 3 (bf, bf brother, me) because we \u201cdon\u2019t take her out enough\u201d. The house is starting to smell like poop & pee because a lot of the time it goes Un-cleaned even if she notices it or someone tells her. I feel like this dog isn\u2019t my responsibility because I didn\u2019t pay for it or have a say in getting it at all. She hasn\u2019t trained her at all and isn\u2019t feeding her the right foods, and lets her mom feed her human food. I\u2019ve tried training the dog basic commands, and to go outside not inside but it\u2019s not working since I\u2019m the only one who does it and I\u2019m basically never home or don\u2019t have time to between work, college, and basic errands. MIL is home ALL day every day \nOn top of all that, she doesn\u2019t clean and blames the 3 of us for making messes & not cleaning it up. I make sure I always put everything away, and throw away my trash. The house is CLUTTERED with things she\u2019s impulsively bought & had no room for, trash, and toys for my boyfriends cousins babies who we have for weeks at a time sometimes. My boyfriends brother is always exempt from cleaning and doing any type of house work or errands because he has ODD and will fly off his handle if someone tries to tell him what to do & he doesn\u2019t want to. She says she does it to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d. He\u2019s lost and ruined almost all the silverware (including the kind I bought because we didn\u2019t have any) , tupaware, etc. I just had to throw away a pan he burned to no saving and she did nothing. \nI\u2019m at a loss for what to do. I\u2019m stressed, depressed, work all the time. I don\u2019t have time for stressful situations like this. Bf says he doesn\u2019t know what to do because she\u2019ll dismiss it / come up with an excuse / yell at him even if it\u2019s about something that\u2019s effecting me.

They both did horrible things to each other and fought constantly. And growing up in that house was traumatizing. Unfortunately I think the years of trauma and denial has turned my mother into that horrible MIL.\nUnfortunately now my SO is stuck in a competition between my grandma and my mother cuz they both still hate each other, my grandmother is winning and it drives my mom crazy. \nFirst my mother was just racist. I\u2019m indian he\u2019s black I knew this was gonna be an issue. Even before I started dating SO my sister and I would always point out her racism. It was a hard battle cuz she\u2019s an ATV (Always The Victim - coined by another Redditer on this sub, love the term) so she always cried about it but eventually some lessons stuck. She was so horrible at first. She assumed the kid in my SOs profile picture was his son and he had lied to me about it, the kid is his nephew who I have met several times at that point, she assumes he is from a bad family and poor, his family is obviously different culturally from mine but have always been kind and welcoming which is better than my family at the moment.\nGrowing up I saw so many of my elder cousin introduce their SOs to my mother before their parents cuz they knew she would be accepting, I always admired her for that, I wish I had my mother as an aunt not a mother cuz she did not extend that curtesy to me. I\u2019ve been with SO for 3 years and though it was slow at first through a lot of crying she has learned to check her some of her racism. I am lucky to have an awesome sister who will stand up for my SO when my mom says racist shit behind our backs and is slowly accepting my SO. Unfortunately it took 3 years to get there, so she missed out on 3 years of getting to know him. My own sister says she feels she doesn\u2019t really know SO because when I bring him around he spends so much time trying to impress my mother and father than just chilling and hanging with the kids. And in the 3 years I\u2019ve seen my mom get to know all my cousins\u2019 SO, joking and treating them like family and she doesn\u2019t do that with my SO even if he is right there.\nMy grandma has not had that problem. She didn\u2019t like him at first cuz I had limited free time and couldn\u2019t spend as much time with her anymore, but that lasted a month. They have spent the last 3 years bonding. She gets excited for him to visit, calls him semi regularly, cooks him sweets, even yells at him like he was a grandkid, mainly for not visiting or calling enough. She also asks him for favors, she\u2019s old. It\u2019s normally to explain bank notices, help fix some minor stuff, like a mini fountain and music box.\nThis has driven my mother crazy recently, she thinks if she asks more of my SO it proves that she is closer with him. She asked him to re-landscape their entire acre property, re-pave the area around the pool, and physically replace their fridge. I think he should do none of it but he says it\u2019s fine, mainly cuz I think he is really desperate to be \u201cpart of the family,\u201d but what really bothers me is how she speaks to him meow. She tried to joke around and kid with him, but that means insulting to her. She does this with everyone but she has a better relationship with everyone else. \nIn regards to quarantine I think she is really losing it. She really wants me to \u201ccome home\u201d despite the fact that I live with SO and there isn\u2019t realistically any more room for me in their house. She doesn\u2019t invite SO to stay just me. Grandma is quarantined to the basement as there are a lot of medical professionals in that house. Every 2 weeks SO and I\u2019ve been going over hanging out with my grandma through a weird half door from the garage to the basement. She\u2019s really lonely. My parents sister cousin SO and I will hang out for an hour or so in the backyard cuz we can stay far away from each other, not my grandma cuz \u201cshe doesn\u2019t feel comfortable in my parents space.\u201d \nUnfortunately my SO\u2019s aunt passed away recently. Aunt\u2019s son called one night and said he just couldn\u2019t cremate his mother alone. SO drove 6 hrs to be with him at the cremation and drove back. I\u2019ve been very strict about quarantine since then. While he was gone I bought groceries and we haven\u2019t left the apt since, I called my grandma and mom to tell them I won\u2019t see them for 2 weekends to let 14 days pass. Both were upset but my mom did not handle it well. She thinks I should leave SO and stay with her for 14 days even though she and my father are medical professionals and there are 5 people already on her house. After I said no she called SO stupid for going. I let it slide once. She called again asking if I was coming yesterday and she called him stupid again. I calmly told her that was rude, and she freaked out, she is just worried so she can be rude, I\u2019m rude for calling her out, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have a daughter like me, SO should understand that she talks to all family this way. True but she made it clear he\u2019s not family so she doesn\u2019t get to do that. I told her her reaction was stupid and hung up.\nLater on my father called to check on me, I explained that I will not be coming to see them anymore and why. Unfortunately my SO overheard the part where my mother called him stupid. He says it\u2019s fine but I know it hurts him. It\u2019s not like he thinks going across state lines to his aunts cremation was smart, but he had to be there for her son. He was the only one who could go as he is young healthy and isn\u2019t working. \nMy sister thinks I should take it as a good thing that it\u2019s a sign that she\u2019s \u201cjoking\u201d with SO but she said it in anger and I know stupid isn\u2019t really a huge insult but I feel very straw that\u2019s broke the camels back. She is amazing and compassionate person, I respected her a lot growing up cuz I saw how much she took care of and supported other people, I just wish SO got that same treatment from her.\n\n"}, {"title": "MIL wants us to make our baby cry more often.

Apparently she said that as I come from a \u2018permissive\u2019 family, it\u2019s up to DH to be the baby enforcer.\nBoth DH and I try to respond to his needs reasonably quickly; we do try to practice a type of attachment parenting that I know seems really foreign to them. He -is- with us a lot (we have this luxury because I\u2019m on extended maternity leave and dh has fairly flexible hours) but he can still easily amuse himself when playing independently.\nThe family believe that the baby is somehow manipulating us and needs to be taught to behave...

What you need to do is....\u201d There has literally not been one response where she was satisfied with how I was handling parenthood. \nOnce when I was talking to her she asked for pictures. My husband sent her one and she immediately found something wrong with it and started lecturing me about how we shouldn\u2019t be doing xyz. \nEven little things...I mentioned how we gave the baby his first sponge bath. What could\u2019ve been a \u201caw what a fun milestone!\u201d Immediately turned to \u201cwell why did he cry? Did you make it fun for him? You probably made the water too cold. How do you know it wasn\u2019t cold? How did you check the temperature? Oh god no...you need to use your elbow to check it! Here\u2019s what you need to do next time...\u201d\nAt times, she\u2019ll even ignore what I actually said to make it sound like I\u2019m doing it wrong so she can give advice. She asked how breastfeeding was going and I said \u201cit\u2019s getting better. My milk finally came in so it got a lot easier and he\u2019s eating constantly now.\u201d She immediately started with the advice \u201cok so no, what I want you to do is make this milk concoction. TRUST ME it\u2019ll help your milk to come in and he\u2019ll actually want to eat it then because it\u2019ll taste better.\u201d I....literally just said my milk is in and he\u2019s eating constantly.  I don\u2019t need to do anything. \nI started trying to get off the phone as soon as she starts with the unwanted criticism and advice. One time when she started I just said \u201cok well I\u2019m gonna go because we\u2019re about to eat.\u201d She immediately started asking questions to get the last bit in...\u201dyou\u2019re going to eat? Well what is your plan with the baby?\u201d Idk mom, probably just leave him on the fucking counter.\nI understand that she\u2019s coming from a good place and just wants to help. I understand that this must be incredibly hard for her not being able to meet her first grandchild. I\u2019m trying to be empathetic. I\u2019m trying to be more willing to do phone calls and video chats because I know it must be hard for her. But for fucks sake, I can\u2019t constantly hear how I\u2019m doing everything wrong anymore. Any advice is appreciated.\n\n"}, {"title": "Nightmare  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "23", "comments": "7", "content": "I just feel like I\u2019m reliving the same nightmare over and over.

She\u2019s overstepping, being nosey, listening in on us, and letting my toddler break the rules. How the hell did this happen? Two months ago I would have never guessed this would be my life now. I have anxiety attacks every day. All my husband and I do now is fight because I\u2019m so depressed being here and he\u2019s doing all he can to help and it\u2019s not helping so we just argue.

Towards the end of the night a family member of my husband's starts asking me about my education and what I was studying. So we had a really good conversation about that and she wishes me the best of luck with my studies and future job, etc.   \nA little while after that, when some more people had left MIL and SIL are sitting near me and that's when MIL asks me about my education.   \n\"Why would you want to go to college?\" she asks.   \nI explain to her what I was studying and hoping to do after graduation and any potential future jobs. She is all very disinterested in this. Under her breath I hear her mock me, saying, \"Oh, college, college.\" In a high pitched, exaggerated voice. Apparently to her, me going to college is me pretending to be something I'm not and thinking I'm better than what I actually am. (For those that don't know, MIL had an issue with me being mixed race and my humble start in life. To her, I should've stayed on 'my side of town.')  \nShe then tries to tell me that I don't need further education because I've got a husband and I can just rely on him and be a housewife and a lady of leisure, etc. I don't need to work as I have a man now and he can work and earn money and I can take care of things in the house. Now, my ex-husband is a very talented cook. We both enjoy cooking and trying new recipes. We used to share the housework and the chores because both of us lived in the house. It was our house, so why not both help out? That was one thing MIL used to like to talk about as well. A man shouldn't be expected to come home and have to work again and do jobs around the house. He's been out working all day he should expect to come home to a hot meal. When I reminded MIL that I worked also and was out of the house, in a very condescending manner she said to me, \"Yes but he works harder than you do dear.\"  \nSo MIL's thing was that women should apparently choose looks over books. MIL chose looks and that's why she had the nice house and successful husband, etc. ( I never say this about other women, as I believe all women are beautiful, but MIL was not as pretty as she thought herself to be. She used to go on and on about her looks and how lucky her husband was to marry someone who was such a rare beauty like she was) and apparently women who chose books are miserable and have nothing in life because men don't go for that.   \nMIL had so many effed up opinions. One of my husband's cousins is a lesbian and MIL used to go on and on about how accepting she was of this and how she didn't have a problem and she was so good towards 'those people', but then she'd refer to it as an illness and mental affliction, etc. \"It's a disease, what she has. She'll get better one day.\"  \nI am still really good friends with my ex-husband, we still get along great and thankfully he's not like his family at all, but I'm glad I got out of there when I did. I couldn't stand much more of that woman.\n\n"}, {"title": "Poor Sweet Hippie reminds me SHE'S the victim here.

Ya ok mom. \nWell she's obviously not getting the point with my dead air silence, because she messaged me again the other day, \"I would sure love some pictures.\" \nSo I said \"I would love a sincere apology and acknowledgment that the things you've said to me are not ok.\" \nIn which 30 seconds later I got this \"I love you, i apologize, I am sorry for hurting you, It was never my intention, I take it back, please forgive me\" \nOOF, lol ok mom, thank you for the most stale ham sandwich of an apology you could muster. But what I said was \"I want you to know that if you talk to me like you did, and you call me names and you lose your temper with me like that, I'm going to stop talking to you. If you ever threaten to hurt yourself on my behalf again, I will call the police to do a wellness check on you. I'm really tired of this mom. I want a healthy relationship with you and that's not what this is.\" Then I resumed silence, and she did too. For two whopping days. \n\"WarDog, it has taken me two nights of no sleep and much thought to know how to answer you.    I realize that no matter what i say, you seem to see the worst in me.    I read what you said and I hope you can read this knowing my true intentions.\nWhen we were in (hometown) and (ex-husband/ wardogs stepdad/ chosen father)  and I had broken up a few weeks before, i had just found out about him seeing (step dad's gf) and had been for many weeks, I broke down.  I don't remember exactly what i said but I know it was pretty low.  I was super depressed and sad.  I had lost all direction.   I know I said stupid things.  I needed a friend.  Instead you called the cops and let them in.   I had three officers hovering over me, they cuffed me, yanked my hair and forced me down on the couch, breaking my laptop.  I was completely shocked and bewildered why you would do this to me.  Over time i realized you were scared ....and i forgave you.   I should not have said things i did not mean.  I was grieving.  I was lost.   I am sorry for saying those things.\n[Adding my thoughts here: she threw a frying pan at me, when I picked it up, she told me to beat her to death with it, I'd be doing her and everyone a favor.  My brother was 11 and terrified, when the cops came they had to hold her down cause she threw wine glasses at them, I was 18 at this point, I'd had the cops called on me at least twice a year for the previous 3 years for \"being a trespasser on her property\" every time she tried to kick me out and I tried to pack anything. But I'm so glad she forgave me for that.]\nThen when you came to (new town) you were angry, we had that big fight.  You threw a rock into that big window, costing me $600 that I certainly could not afford.  I said nothing.   I forgave you.\n[She threw my guitar over the balcony, I Sparta booted the window in anger (I know) I paid her back over $1000 for the window less than six months later because she started spreading rumors among my entire family that I was a violent criminal, she still brings this up every single fight we have, conveniently always forgets I paid her back almost twice what it was worth]\nI have helped you, given you a home when you needed it, paid for you, moved to a place that was better for all of us. (New bf) got you a car at wholesale, we set you on your way when you moved to Victoria, you sold that car for more than double what you paid for it while we wished we had stayed where we were.  I forgave you. \n[I have no idea what she's talking about with any of this. I bought a car at wholesale value that she made me live in for a month before I moved several hours away, apparently she's sour that I sold it for more than I paid for it? She wished I'd stayed where she was? What? She kicked me out, then spent 3 weeks sending me smiley emojis every couple hours until I moved away]\nOur last conversation, i told you i wouldn't be around much longer. What I started to tell you was I was planning on taking a job teaching with my friend in Puerto Vallarta.  I see now how quickly you assumed i meant something else.... that i was suicidal.  No.  I'm certainly not, never have been.  Sad, lonely, depressed, yep, needing a friend, yep, suicidal, no.  Looking for happiness, yep.  \n[Bullshit bullshit bullshit, she said this with the context of hurting me, she even agreed with me when I called her out on it, saying she still felt that way, but ok mom]\nYou moved to (new place), I understand completely.  It made sense.  But it left me feeling that as far away as you were, you could easily come see me in Mexico or I could come see you.  You got upset though and reminded me you were due to have a baby in March and the conversation ended there. \n[Asked her if she was coming to meet my newborn when he was born (before covid) she said no, she was taking a vacation to Mexico over my due date. WHAT]\nBut now i see that you took this comment completely wrong and there you are ready to call the cops again, ready to send me away in a straight jacket and see me rot in some locked room somewhere.   \nYou asked for an apology, a sincere one.  I gave it to you, very sincerely.  Yet you return it with more chastisement, more anger.  Not forgiveness.\nI just wanted a few photos of my grandchildren.   That's all.  \nSo now you have heard my side of this.  I honestly don't know what to expect at this point.  It's up to you.  I have nothing but love for you.  I want a healthy relationship with you, but I can't keep being hurt by you.  \nI wish you could see the best in me, accept me for who I am.  I am not perfect but I am certainly not the monster you make me out to be.  I have always helped you, supported you, loved you.  \nI eon't know what else to say.\"\nThat's fine mom, you don't need to say anything else. But you did leave me with something to say, which is good riddance. Have fun in Mexico, glad you're so alright with not seeing your grandchildren cause that's what's going to happen. Have a happy life, I mean that genuinely, I don't wish Ill on you, I don't wish you anything but contentment, then hopefully you'll leave me alone. My children will be happy and loved with the family they have, when they ask about you... Well I'm still figuring out what to tell them, but I won't be unkind. Just honest. It's time to lay in your bed. Although I know this won't be the last time I have to remind you of the mess YOU made. Until then...

Im going to tell a story about something that happened last year with JNMIL. I\u2019m just venting. I don\u2019t have anyone who knows me or my situation well enough to vent to, and I don\u2019t want to do it to DH because that is his mother. \nTRIGGER WARNING- MENTION OF DRUGS \nTLDR; MIL abandons DS to run off with new lover, leaves us with no child care, gets addicted to drugs, still wants to be involved to this day\nSo I\u2019ll start with when I met MIL. She seemed nice enough but a little standoffish towards me. I noticed right off the bat she was sort of slow-speaking, and acted like a teenager. Not annoying or anything but, always wanted a bunch of friends around, always wanted out of the house, and she smoked weed. I have no judgements towards anyone who smokes, it was just different for me because when I was growing up I never met a grown up who smoked weed (that I knew of).\nAnyways, DH and I got pregnant and we talked to MIL a lot about babysitting once DS was born. We hashed everything out and she said she would be happy to. 6 weeks after having DS I went back to work.\nThings were good for about 8 months. Then her behavior became more erratic. There were a lot of times that I would be on the way to drop DS off and she would not be there (she doesn\u2019t work). I had to wake up her husband (DH\u2019s stepdad), because I\u2019d have to be at work 20 minutes later. She didn\u2019t understand that because she was late to everything doesn\u2019t mean I was going to be late too. She\u2019d get mad at me for waking her husband up because he worked 2nd shift at the time. But what am I supposed to do??\nSo that went on for about a month. Then she would have friends over every single time I dropped DS off. There were a few sketchy people but I didn\u2019t really have a choice of who I\u2019d be dropping my son off to, she was our only option. One time I came to pick him up and the whole apartment smelled like weed.\nLike I said, I do not judge if other people smoke. I personally don\u2019t but my husband does. But he knows not to do it in front of our baby. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time but I asked DH to say something. He did and MIL said it wouldn\u2019t happen again. A few weeks later.. the falling out happened.\nI had to work late one day and I texted MIL telling her I would be 2 hours late and to ask DH if he could pick up DS. What I didn\u2019t know at the time is DH was working late too. My bad, I didn\u2019t think it was that big a deal as DS would likely be sleeping anyways. When I look back I can see how it could be perceived as inconsiderate though. \nI got off 2 hours late and raced over to see if DS was still there, and he was. MIL was pissed. But this was also the first time this had ever happened, in my defense. Anyways, MIL proceeded to yell at me in front of my son (and her friend that she had over). I get the being pissed part. I really do. But you cannot yell at me in front of my son. I packed his stuff up and apologized and left. She said don\u2019t come back tomorrow. \nWe figured something out. I don\u2019t remember, I think one of us had to call into work. But I made sure to let DH know what his mother had said to me the night before. He was as pissed as I was. He told her not to speak to me like that again or she would never see her grandson again. \nA few days after that I drop him off again. MIL apologizes for the other day, saying there was a lot of drama going on at home. Her car got keyed by someone, I was like dang that sucks. Trying to sympathize. We patched things up.\nA week later I\u2019m getting ready for work when MIL texts me saying her husband is going to watch DS that day. She says she\u2019s staying in another city and we probably don\u2019t want DS to be where she is (because that side of town has a lot of drugs) \u201cbut it\u2019s up to us\u201d. I say ok, I\u2019ll drop him off with your husband. \nI show up and her husband had no idea about this conversation. She didn\u2019t even SPEAK to him about watching DS that day. That was the day she ran off with her lover. Because of her recent behavior (there\u2019s more that I didn\u2019t include here), I was scared to death all week that I would drop him off with her husband and she would come and take him away, to some strangers house 2 cities away. \nLuckily for DH and I, MIL\u2019s husband was laid off just that week. Thank god he cleared his schedule for us, or I definitely would have had to quit my job on the spot to watch my son. The next week we put him in daycare. The daycares in my area are hard to get into. Every single one I called was completely full except one, the one he got into, our only choice. \nSo weeks go by and every now and then we\u2019ll hear through MIL\u2019s friends that she\u2019s on this drug or that drug, that they saw her and she looked like she lost 50 pounds, that she\u2019s living in her car etc. Its been almost a year now since she\u2019s abandoned DS. \nMIL keeps asking for help financially as her and her lover both don\u2019t have a job and are going from couch to couch. We definitely can\u2019t help and we aren\u2019t letting her stay in our home, not after what she did and how she treated me. I do not feel sympathy. She is a compulsive liar and will say anything if you give her money. \nAround Christmas time, she went back to stay with her husband (they are still married to this day). We took DS to see her and tell her to stop messing with her lover, that person is a bad influence and they are making her into a version of herself that is unrecognizable. We told her she needs to go to rehab, live with her dad if that would help, and get some real help. \nShe broke down in tears saying things like \u201cif you only knew how bad I\u2019ve wanted to get out..\u201d or \u201cyou have no idea the things I\u2019ve been through\u201d. Well, turns out it was all BS to have somewhere to stay for the holidays. At this point I had already blocked her number and all social media\u2019s, but DH told me she had posted a selfie the next day of her and her lover cuddling on the couch in the living room of her husbands apartment. \nShe went on to keep asking DH and other family members for money, and almost everyone says no every time. MIL\u2019s father has a soft spot though. Truly a wonderful man. He\u2019s at a complete loss. He calls DH every other day, saying I don\u2019t know what to do with her, I don\u2019t know if I should lend her money. DH doesn\u2019t want to be involved after what happened at Christmas. \nAt this point DH accepts that MIL got herself into the situation she\u2019s in and she will not get help. He will not lend her money and he also accepts at this point that he could get a call at any given time that his mother had passed away.  He assures me that MIL was a normal mother when he was a kid but she got into a car accident with a SEPARATE LOVER (whole other story), and has had a few strokes and she isn\u2019t the same anymore. \nNow, DS goes to grandpas house (DH\u2019s dad, MIL\u2019s ex-husband) every week and I\u2019ve been hearing MIL\u2019s been visiting him. Honestly I don\u2019t want him to see her, I don\u2019t want him to know who she is, I don\u2019t even want her to touch him or play with him. I\u2019ll always see her as the one who abandoned our son when we needed her. Honestly, in my humble opinion, she is a disgusting person and I wish she would either just go back to her husband or go away for good. She wants to have her cake and eat it too. \nMy son is only 1 now (almost 2). So he doesn\u2019t know what happened, and to my knowledge he doesn\u2019t even recognize MIL anymore. Ngl I\u2019m kind of glad he doesn\u2019t. The last thing I want is for my son to get hurt by someone as careless and negligent as MIL. Obviously he wouldn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s not his fault. And obviously I wouldn\u2019t ever tell him all this, that\u2019s why I\u2019m venting here. \nThere are a few more things I\u2019d like to vent about MIL, if I may. For one thing, she has a 16 year old daughter. Not only did she abandon DS, she also abandoned her own daughter, and this is the SECOND time this has happened to her. I truly feel sorry for my sister in law. She doesn\u2019t show it but I know she\u2019s hurt by it. \nAnd then there was tax season. Oh god. So MIL\u2019s been trying to get money from all different sources (except for working of course), for her drugs. That\u2019s all she cares about at this point. Drugs and her lover (who beats her, allegedly). So at tax season, first of all, this bitch filed head of household. How can you be head of household with no job??? Just insulting. Then she got money back because of sister in law. Because she is a dependent. \nHere\u2019s where things are especially fucked up with their relationship. So she abandons her, right? Well sister in law went to live with her girlfriend, and her girlfriends mom is fully supporting her. Feeding her. Putting a roof over her head. Do you want to know how much money MIL gave SIL or SIL\u2019s gf\u2019s mom??? Nothing. Not. A. Thing. Of course. \nSo there was that, and then the fact that she got a stimulus check with an extra $500 for SIL and SIL saw none of it. SIL works 2 jobs and has no car.\nI\u2019m sorry, but MIL is such a piece of shit. I\u2019ve never been close to her and I feel no sympathy towards her. The way I see it, is if she wanted help she could get it. But she doesn\u2019t. She wants to keep using drugs and being with her lover. Meanwhile she\u2019s still getting her way and seeing our son. I just don\u2019t get her. She\u2019s absolutely the most selfish person that I know. \nDH feels bad for her but knows there is nothin he can do to help. We\u2019ve found another option for child care recently, so we can save some money thankfully. I just want to go on with my life and not see her again. But I know I have to, or at least I\u2019ll have to hear about whatever dumb shit she done that day. \nI hope if anyone reads this that they can understand I am writing all this out of pure emotion. All of this has happened in the past year or so. I don\u2019t mean to sound like someone who has no sympathy for drug users or addicts, because I truly do. But for her I don\u2019t. I understand that addiction is an illness and those people need help. \nPlease comment if you have a similar story, I love to read this subreddit but I feel like I don\u2019t see many posts similar to my situation. I would love to support anyone going through the same thing as me.\n\n"}, {"title": "In Which I Have a Baby and Somehow it's all about my JNMOM  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "289", "comments": "22", "content": "TLDR: We went an email with communication and other expectations around the birth of our kid. Everyone agreed and then my parents immediately started breaking boundaries and turning this all into an attack against them.\nI just gave birth to my second baby. About a week before giving birth, I sent an email to all our family members with information about how we would keep people informed during labor and setting boundaries of how to communicate. Essentially it was Spouse will send information when we head to the hospital. He'll give further information up to the point where I'm in Active Labor at which point he'll stop. He'll send out a text after baby is born and we have our golden hour with her. In order for me to focus on labor and bonding, please send all communication through him. He will be focused on me, so do not expect answers right away. We will not send pictures until Older Daughter gets to meet her sister. Please do not post any birth announcements or pictures we do send on any social media. We will figure out window visits after we get home and see the pediatrician.\nEveryone acknowledged these expectations and I even got a thank you from some of my family members for sending it out.\nBaby was born via c-section, which was not the original plan. Spouse communicated with everyone what was happening. I called my parents at one point because we didn't pack for a long hospital stay and I was bored. We chatted about nothing. When it was time to go to surgery, Spouse texted everyone and mentioned he'd text again when we were in recovery. Baby was born at around 5:30 after an uneventful surgery. I spent my time in recovery either breastfeeding or sleeping. Spouse texted relevant baby info minus a picture. Added that we were all healthy. We got a number of congratulations and the like.We were transferred to recovery after two hours\u2026 so around 8 PM. It took another 45 minutes or so to chat with nurses. Finally everyone left and we spent the night either asleep, breastfeeding, or doing the every four hour vitals checks. We woke up around 6:30 when a pediatrician came in to check baby again. As she was leaving, the nurse came for vitals check and mentioned I was allowed to eat clear liquids. As I'd not eaten in 24 hours, I was thrilled. I ordered food and then the nurse talked about the plan for the day. Spouse sent round a morning text that we were healthy, I was getting food, and that we were about to see a flurry of doctors and nurses so we'd talk more when we had time.\nI finally got my food. It's hard to screw up hospital jello. Ate, fed baby, then looked at my phone where there were two texts only to me. One from my mom from before I'd even woken up that morning asking if she could get a text for assurances of our health and one from my dad timestamped after Spouse's text saying he didn't believe that I was so busy talking to doctors that I couldn't spare a minute to text hello to people. He also implied that Spouse was texting his parents more than my parents which was not true and threw in my face that I only called them when I was bored.I waited long enough that I deemed I was ready as that was the plan - I would text when I was ready. I sent a text that said, both Baby and I were healthy. I was recovering from major abdominal surgery which involves lots of sleeping. And I was happy to have just finally had my first real food in 24 hours. Got a text back from Mom that was overjoyed happy to hear.\nBecause of the c-section we were in hospital longer than we had planned, so our expectations had to change. We decided we were going to have Older Daughter meet her sister via video chat. My in-laws were great, they dialed and handed the phone to Older Daughter and then basically left the room. We chatted with her. Then we texted both sets of grandparents to set up video chats to meet baby. Everything went fine.\nWe were discharged from the hospital today. Sent 'round some photos of us leaving the hospital, baby in carseat, etc. Almost everyone sent your standard \"Yay!\" texts. Some she's so cute. My mom sent a text to just me, my dad, and Spouse that was basically, \"Can't wait to meet her!\" We ignored text for a few hours while we got home and settled. I showered. We ate lunch. Brought Older Daughter home who was thrilled to meet Baby.\nAs the afternoon wore on, I went through my phone to respond to some of the other texts that had come through. I came to the one from my mom and replied saying, \"Yup. Us too. Will set up a window visit later this week after the pediatrician visit.\" I get back a text from my dad (my mom sends him on us when she's upset because she has this idea that we respond better to him than to her) saying that of course it's our decision but he's disappointed that we wouldn't even try to do that. I responded with, \"Jesus, I just had major abdominal surgery and you guys seem to be taking everything as an affront against you.\" He sent back a long text about how it's not that they're taking it as an affront. He just doesn't understand why we can't do the bare minimum to make them feel better and have them meet their grandkid and he doesn't understand how waving through a window is that hard. And they've tried to be very respectful of our demands but they don't understand the need for them. And any grandparent would say these rules are silly.\nSo I replied that we clearly set out our expectations from the beginning and everyone acknowledged and agreed to them. The only people who are having trouble following these expectations are him and Mom. I told them I honestly don't care that they find it unreasonable. I added that I was hurt that they didn't seem to understand that recovering from surgery while learning how a new member fit into the family was super important and that instead they were more worried about their own feelings. I finished with the fact that I was going to take another day to recover, as a family we are going to take a day to bond, and we are not setting up any visits until we see our pediatrician. I also added I wasn't interested in discussing it any further and I wasn't going to respond to any texts or phone calls.\nAnd what really pisses me off is I knew this was going to happen. We set up those boundaries in the first place so it was very clear what was going to happen. They keep talking about how I'm not paying attention to their feelings and yeah, I'm not. Because they're feelings don't enter into this conversation. I'm recovering from surgery. I have a newborn. There is a pandemic. They can feel as hurt and disappointed as they want, but it doesn't change the fact that no one is visiting this baby, whether through the window or not, until stairs are somewhat easy for me and I feel comfortable holding her while standing. There's also this implication in all the texts that we're A) doing this to hurt them and B) giving Spouse's family more information or letting them do more things. From the start we have been equal to each family. Spouse texts my family first even, and then copy pastes the text into his family text and sends them the same information.\nI'm also very hurt that for two people who say they love and respect me, they don't show it. If they really loved and respected me, they'd back the fuck off and let us recover. Instead they're making it all about themselves, and when I call them out on it, they try to make me sound unreasonable.\nHave to say, it felt really good to say, \"Yeah, I just don't care about your feelings right now.\" Right now rehearsing the shut down for when they bring it up again. Because I really don't care anymore. I've spent way too much of my life trying to pander to their feelings and not getting what I want instead.  \nETA: deleted extra word.\n\n"}, {"title": "How does a mother\u2019s narcissism affect her children?

She owned the home and we stupidly didn\u2019t pay rent.  She loved it because she felt superior to all the other moms around and constantly complimented herself by saying how supportive she was. Greige initially tried to be my best friend and adored me because I would spew up word vomit when asked instrusive questions by her (due to my own JustNo upbringing and having few defenses).  Over time she got more and more instusive and annoying.  When rude and mean she would gaslight and rugsweep and never own up to her behaviors.\nWhen DH came into some family money (nothing life altering but the equivalent of about two years salary) from a real estate sale she lost her mind and after a decade of playing nice decided that I was a gold digging foreign refugee bitch.  She became obsessive about planning for DHs imminent death by trying to force him to write a will ensuring I would get nothing upon his death (note our country does not have trusts and DH is perfectly healthy) and she also wanted to dictate if he could give his organs upon death or not (newflash shes for the not bc \u201cshe carried him in her belly for 9 months and has her say on this and doesn\u2019t want her sons lungs to go to brown people\u201d,  DH has since updated the status).\nDue to the loving family environment hellhole we were in, where I literally could not leave my house without passing by Greige\u2019s front door and window, she would \u201caccidentaly\u201d open our mail, etc etc, we just couldn\u2019t take it at a certain point and DH and I decided to move out on our own.  We bought a small place and redid it on our own. We found and paid for our place 100% on our own with no family help nor touching any family money though his cash could have helped us buy a bigger place, I did not want to owe her anything since she made me feel so little.  Note that keeping this away from her was a lot of work because a) she would open our locked mailbox accidentally all the time, b) she had full access to all of DHs non-joint accounts and c) buying a house in our country plus construction took like 10 months.  \nWe showed Greige our place when it was finished and she lost her mind.  Since she considers herself a real estate expert she was greatly offended.  Regarding our place because its on the ground floor she said its nothing better than a glorified fishbowl, a doctors office at best, and this was certainly not worthy of her son and that he would end up coming back to mommy after our inevitable divorce.  She even rented out our current place on a short term lease because she is so convinced that DH will come back to her.  She told me that she's hated me for a decade and that she never wanted anything to do with me again and she had no idea how I could do this to her.  She said she never wanted anything to do with me again and that I should just let DH go see her once in a while.  Of course she told me all this when DH was not home.  This was 3 years ago.\nWhat she didn't bank on is that DH was just done and didn't want to see her.  Her lack of support in the end hurt him a lot. When we first moved she sent her FMs to try and guilt DH, then she tried to play the guilt card about herself, trying to use financial strings, guilty texts galore, never asking about him and certainly not me etc.  This year (and I so fucking called her reaction) there was to be a big family even that has been postponed due to Covid.  I knew this would break her mind since she expected DH to attend and now well its probably another year she won't see him.  It's been 3 years of no visits or phone calls though I tell him if he wants to go, feel free!  Just count me out.\nLast week she texted this out of the blue:\nI'm just so sad and devastated to know where you live, Especially right now with Quarantine \ud83d\ude22, Look for something else \nDH did not reply because he has learned to not feed the trolls.  Note the troll was stupidly fed while initially at the beginning of Covid would ask about his temperature etc.  He responded but you give a centimeter and she wants a mile....\nToday he got a doozy\nThe lack of your presence during the Coronavirus crisis regarding us has made me ask a lot questions... Do you want to cut all ties with us ??  If you don\u2019t respond, as it\u2019s your habit, I\u2019ll take that for a yes. At least I\u2019ll know !!!  It makes me so sad.   But that...im sure is of no importance to you. \nDH finally wants to tell her what he thinks.  Can you guys please let us know what you think of this response. \nI am sick of being treated like an idiot.  You don't even imagine that I could pick and choose my own appartement.  In the middle of COVID, if my health truly worried you then you could have called my wife instead of calling my friends.  My wife merits respect and in no circumstances the violence with which you have treated her.  Instead of being happy that your son is independent during such uncertain times you continue to busy yourself by manipulating your entourage to make me look bad, probably out of boredom.  Certain family friends could not even hide their surprise when they visited \"our tenement without a view\".  You seem to be unhappy that I am no longer dependent nor under your supervision.  I realized how unhappy I was at home when I was so thrilled to be constantly overworked and travelling.  Your constant comments about my work, pets, hobbies, friends, life have hurt me over time.    I don't understand how a mother, while certainly possessive, could be so heinous.  Everything is always rug-swept, nothing is acknowledged or owned up to or everything is reformulated as if nothing ever occurred.  I have no interest in communicating or maintaining ties in this kind of a situation, it seems toxic and healthy.  As someone over 30, well advanced in life, I have one wish and that is to live my life quietly without constantly having to justify my actions nor feeling controlled and under surveillance.   I am very sad to no longer see Grandma but I know that I could no longer give her my side of the story.   I've sent her flowers since our move without ever receving a word.  Quite bizarre since she was always so polite. \nDH isn't sure on what kind of a note to end.  There are some financial ties he would like to cut.  Does he mention them now?

We will be starting our senior years of undergrad and we live at home during breaks from school (and currently in quarantine). We plan to get engaged after college and move to another state where he can start his career and I can begin med school. Throughout our whole relationship, MIL has made snide comments towards me that go mostly unnoticed except by me. I am an atheist and she knows this and SO has been seriously reconsidering his religion. MIL is very Catholic which is the bane of most MIL related issues. One of the biggest problems throughout SO and I\u2019s relationship is that MIL insists on converting me to Catholicism. I was raised Catholic until I was about 12 when my parents let me decide and I chose not to continue practicing, therefore I didn\u2019t make my confirmation. She has made this a point that I must be confirmed, attend church with them, and overall just be converted. His oldest brother (30) has been married for 4 years and MIL also despises SIL just based on the fact that BIL and SIL got pregnant before marriage. Some examples of this are calling SIL a whore for being pregnant before marriage (but it takes two to tango right? her son did not get any issues from her!) and recently berated BIL in front of the whole family (minus SIL) because SIL wanted to take their kids to a certain church and held her ground and MIL insisted on another church. Recently, MIL decided that I am a terrible fit for her son because SO told her that he thought a nearby park would be a lovely place for a wedding and she thinks we must get married in a church. Here is the drama that ensued: \nMIL insisted that we must get married in the church or else he will not be Catholic anymore and cannot raise kids Catholic. She then cried and screamed for 3 hours. When she does this, she does not allow anyone else to speak or she will cry and scream louder.\nMIL and FIL made SO pray the rosary 3 times and then promise to pray the rosary at least twice a day for the next month. \nMIL said that I was evil, immoral, and raised poorly by my parents. She then said I must be trying to convert him to an atheist, despite me saying numerous times I would support any religion SO chooses, would agree to a priest officiating our wedding, and would raise future children Catholic.\nMIL told SO that they would financially cut him off if he did not promise to remain Catholic. FIL is a CEO and they are very wealthy, and therefore have payed for all 3 kid\u2019s college tuition, weddings, and any other financial help they needed.\nMIL said that she respects SO\u2019s choice of religion and if we get married because she loves him, but then continued to pressure him to remain Catholic, to break up with me, and scream and cry at least 4 hours or more a day for the past week. This includes while SO was taking a timed final exam for college.\nMIL said that (before we started quarantining) SO spent too much time at my house (a couple days a week) and she felt as if he cared more about me, did not want to be part of their family anymore, and that he should \u201cjust move in\u201d with me.\nMIL has maintained a midnight curfew for SO (not because he wakes them when he comes home, but because they feel unloved if he is not home in time) and does not allow him to stay over. He has come home at the latest 12:30, but she said because of this he is untrustworthy and they will he moving his curfew to an earlier time.\nAnd finally, the big kicker, today when SO confronted MIL and asked kindly that although he respects and loves her, she be less controlling because he will be moving out in one year and needs to learn to live a little on his own. She then said she\u2019s not controlling, but giving him guidance. She told him a story about how her mother told her brother than his wife was terrible, he did not listen, and then she cheated on him with a drug dealer and said that she is worried SO will suffer the same fate.\nI\u2019m just at a loss for words here. I have been nothing but kind to SO\u2019s family for 2 whole years. SO and I rarely fight, and I love him dearly and have never and will never do anything to harm him. And regarding the cheating comment, my father cheated on my mom when I was 14 and I was extremely upset for years and still have a tumultuous relationship with him 7 years later (and she knows this!). SO assured me that we can move away in a year and she will not have to be involved in our lives, but I feel terrible because they have always been very close.

After drinking a few beers together one night we hooked up. I felt terrible because I cheated so I broke up with my boyfriend, and DH was confused because he always thought he was straight (I mean obviously he wasn't.) About six months later, he being 24 and me 22, we started dating. I was kept a secret because DH was terrified because of his parents religious beliefs. I was introduced as his \"friend\" for two years before getting caught kissing. His family was split, half saying he needed christ, and half saying they accepted him. His mom, and two of his sisters did not accept him (he had 4 siblings, three sisters and one brother.)\nWhen we got married around 2015 (we made a quick plan after gay marriage was legalized.) The family that disapproved refused to show, besides JNMIL because she was FIL date. And yes, they did try to mess up the wedding. Tried to knock over the cake, tried to mess up the playlist, tried to ruin my dance with my mom, and finally tried to put wine on me (my mom and dad are very protective.) This also embarrassed FIL, and was the final straw in a big pile of things, and was lead to a divorce.\nFinally a little over two years ago, the only sister that accepted DH's sexuality and his and my relationship got in a car crash. She died a few days later. Her husband and son (9 at the time, 11 now) were distraught. Her husband couldn't deal with it and asked DH and I to take his son (now DN (dear nephew)). We took him in and he still calls us his uncles. JNMIL is still pissed DH isn't having kids of his own and that we got DN and not her.\n\u200b\nNow to the story. Due to this pandemic, and JNMILs incredible manipulation, she has been staying with us. DH, DN, JNMIL, and I were in the living room playing board games and watching movies. DH went to the kitchen with DN to start making cookies. JNMIL looked at me and it kinda went down like this.\nJNMIL: \"So, is DN just a replacement then?\"\nMe: \"I'm sorry, replacement?\"\nJNMIL: \"For a child, DH said you always wanted kids. And I know he always did. Now your both in your mid-thirties. So, naturally I have to think DN is a replacement of sorts since you two obviously can't have children.\"\nMe: \"Children aren't things, they aren't just place holders for each other. DH and I obviously wanted kids but things don't work out sometimes.\"\nJNMIL: \"Yes, I'm sure that how you view it. But is that how DH views it?\"\nMe: \"WE will talk about it with each other, thank you.\"\nJNMIL rolled her eyes. \"Just seems like things are getting old with you two.\"\nI don't know why but that made me panic. And she picked up on that. For the next few days she had been tormenting me by brining up all the thing DH and I hadn't done together (going on vacation to certain places, having kids, how we got together so young etc.) Things I didn't even know DH was telling her. I am scared that this might not be a manipulation attempt but her warning me. I know she hates me but maybe this is her claiming her victory? Does that make sense?

My (soon to be ex) husband and I were in the middle of building a house. His parents had loaned us a nice sum of money to start it. I was the only one working to support us and pay for the rest of the house out of pocket while husband did the actual building. He relapsed into hard drug use, started stealing money from me for drugs, taking out loans on my paychecks without telling me, stopped working on the house and became erratic and borderline abusive. I leave him. I try to call his parents to talk about it, but JNMIL won\u2019t speak to me and says not to contact her or FIL. I had left a diamond necklace that my mother had given me at their house and I asked her if she could at least please return it. She said she didn\u2019t know where it was, she might have thrown it away. (She was deep into a terrifying gambling addiction at that point so I figured she pawned it. Oh well.)\nCut to 18 months later. I\u2019ve moved out of state. My ex had dragged his feet on filing his paperwork and it took a full year for the divorce to be official. The legally binding agreement that we compromised on was when the house sold, I\u2019d get half of the appraised value at the time of separation after paying his parents back the loan. I was owed about $10,000. About a year later, the house sold. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t have a lien on it (DUMB ASS MISTAKE!!) so when i found out, I contacted him about getting my share. He freaked out, told me I wasn\u2019t getting a dime and to fuck off. Haven\u2019t heard from him since (about 8 years ago.) \nA few months after that last phone call, his mother, who I had not heard from in three years, sends me an email. It was very brief and curt asking if I could please return the handmade gift her husband had given me over five years ago because it was a family heirloom and she wanted to give it to her granddaughter. Folks, I almost freaking lost it! There were a million things I wanted to say to her but after consulting with my own mother I sent a reply along these lines:\n\u201cHello JNMIL, how nice to hear from you after so long. I hope your family is well, especially ex-husband. I have to say I was a little concerned for him after the last time we talked and he refused to honor the terms of our divorce regarding the sale of the house. I hope he paid you back for your generous loan because he certainly didn\u2019t send me my check. As for the gift, it\u2019s been so long, I\u2019m sorry to say I\u2019m not sure where it is, I may have thrown it away. Best wishes!\u201d Also: I still have the gift, I love it and use it daily. It reminds both me of the kindness of my ex FIL and of the tiny, petty revenge I managed to eke out of that toxic situation.\n\n"}], [{"title": "BF\u2019S MOM WONT FOLLOW WHO GUIDELINES FOR THE CORONAVIRUS AND IT\u2019S RUINING OUR RELATIONSHIP  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "50", "comments": "45", "content": "Hey guys, I feel really defeated right now. I am on the verge of tears and I really need some advice. Me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 4 years. We never really have any problems other than when we fight about his mother. Long story short, my boyfriend is a victim of emotional incest from his mother. She\u2019s always been crazy, possessive and obsessed of my boyfriend from the beginning. The first year of our relationship, she made tantrums when he wanted to hang out with me instead of her, jump on his bed at night and demand cuddles and movie nights as she clung on his arms and kisses him on the lips without his permission. The thing is, he\u2019s not the typical momma\u2019s boy who enjoys this. He tell me that the things his mom does makes him uncomfortable but I think the way his mom raised him made him very insecure and he never stands up for himself so he genuinely feels bad and never tells her no. \nWe\u2019ve had countless fights about her. The most recent one being the coronavirus. His parents are rich and his mom and step dad fight all the time so they purchased an apartment for the mother to go to whenever the fought. Well, they\u2019ve been fighting plenty so she\u2019s been 24/7. Fast forward you the coronavirus, her mother has a coworker she interacts with everyday that tested positive. Upon knowing this, I immediately told him that he should tell his mom to self-isolate in the apartment so she doesn\u2019t spread it to him, his brother and his step father. My bf is also coming over in 2 weeks for something school related as we are graduating seniors where he will self quarantine with me and family in our home. (He is from LA, I\u2019m from SF) The thing is, his mom is genuinely dumb and can\u2019t live without seeing her precious sons. She refuses to self isolate/quarantine because she says she \u201cfeels fine\u201d even though I keep telling my boyfriend that symptoms don\u2019t usually show up until 2 weeks. My bf feels the same way but yet again, he\u2019s too scared and he feels bad to tell her that so he broke social distancing rules and hung out with her by going on a drive for a couple hours, getting food together and watching a movie etc. Normally I would probably just tell him to keep his distance and just shut up if he and his mom don\u2019t listen but what really aggravates me if the fact that he\u2019s coming to my family\u2019s house and may spread it to me and my family. The next day after this argument, him and his mother STILL didn\u2019t listen and went on a hike together. (The weird thing is, his mom also purposely doesn\u2019t invite her husband and my bf\u2019s brother; she only wants it to be her and my bf every single time)\nI can go on and tell you all more horror stories of what she\u2019s done but it will be VERY long. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I feel defeated. I feel like he will never stand up to her. Deep down I know I don\u2019t want to date someone like that but he makes me feel very guilt for wanting to break up and calls me a \u201cdictator\u201d for making that decision. At the same time, I don\u2019t know if I should be patient and wait for the day for him to grow, learn and stand up to her. Thoughts?\nTl;dr my bf never stands up to his mom and is too scared to do so in fear that he\u2019ll hurt her feelings. What should I do? I don\u2019t know if I should leave or stay.\n\n"}, {"title": "Feeling Guilty - I don't like my MIL  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "23", "comments": "15", "content": "Yesterday my husband and I \"zoom'd\" his Mom as she wanted to say hi and wish us a happy anniversary.\nI have a long history with his mom. I was warned from the beginning by her friends that she is a narcissist. I personally think she cares about people, but displays narc tendencies. I do not believe she is a narcissist.\nYesterday I spoke to her for the first time in a while. She wouldn't even look at me on the camera. She asked after my parents and then cut me off to start talking about something completely different. It was the one personal question she asked during the phone call. She rants and talks a million miles an hour and is often angry at something or someone and tells us these stories. My husband said she wasn't like this when he was growing up, but started behaving this way when he got married, also around the time we think she started to go through menopause and her husband (my FIL) attempted suicide.\nI suppose I can't do anything here. We are already sending her money and helping them financially (she refuses to work and is 62 years old - as long as I've known her she hasn't wanted to work). And now they need help. My FIL is lovely - I love him very much. He is very unwell and she makes him go to work every day as \"its his job to take care of her\". This sickens me as he has had a hard life with her.\nI feel guilty. I see families with warm relationships between families and we don't have that with my husband's family. My parents are lovely but difficult in their own way - they have separated and gotten back together a number of times, so thats a weird dynamic. But they are good kind people and we love them. But my MIL is something else. The stories are awful so I won't get into them. I want more than anything to like her. Every time we \"zoom\" I try to feel positive and ask her nice questions. We aren't close but I am over feeling mad at her for the things she has done to us over the years. I approach our catchups feeling open minded and just wanting a warm family connection. But she rants and raves and mostly ignores me every time we catch up.\nI suspect I have to suck it up and move on emotionally. I have stopped talking to her in the past but then given in. Am I too soft? I wish this didn't hurt so much.\n\n"}, {"title": "Weird mother/son connection?

I loved those games as a kid and I had so much time on my hands that I bought it and began playing at the beginning of quarantine. My husband saw how much I enjoyed it so he got a copy for himself. His brother and fianc\u00e9 heard how much fun we were having so they both got the game as well. So now we as young adults have been playing together, regularly talking on the phone as a group and exchanging items or visiting each other on the game. \nJNMIL has this thing where she hates not being in the loop. My last post, Pok\u00e9mon NO, shows how she hates not being part of what her sons are into. Well since we all were visiting today (Shelter in Place has lifted in my state), we all got together to play the game. Apparently JNMIL has been listening to our calls and has decided she wants to play too. She mentioned several times today she wants to play with us, but Switch consoles are sold out pretty much everywhere. \nI\u2019m just weirded out by this. Technically, we\u2019re all a little old to be playing this game and we probably would never have played if not for the virus. But it\u2019s been a fun bonding time for us young adults and I don\u2019t see why she needs to insert herself into our fun? She did the same thing with Pok\u00e9mon go when that came out. \nOne time my husband (when we were just dating) bought me two bracelets as a gift for me and she made him give her one. It\u2019s just little things that she inserts herself into. \nIdk, it\u2019s hard to figure out what weirds me out so much about her. And my husband does not see it the way I do.

She has had a bit of trouble grieving after her father passed, but she is in therapy and is doing a bang up job. She's honestly the strongest person I know, she's on the final semester of her nursing degree while working a full time job as a first responder to support her mom and younger brother. But I can gush more another time, on to my JNMom.\nI've gone NC with her, and weirdly enough, I didn't even have to be the one to initiate it! I have (or had) been doing my thing, still messaging her for holidays to keep the peace. My SO and I even finally made the trip out to see her a couple times since my last post. The last post I saw from her book of faces was a woe is me post a couple of days before Christmas about how her children don't put up with her BS anymore. Well, her exact words were \"they've inflicted their own form of torture on me.\" The reality? She texted me 5 days before Christmas expecting me to get my brothers to drop their plans and have all of us head to her place. I let her know that I'd made plans two months prior and I didn't feel comfortable asking that of my brothers, either.\nAnyways, she went quiet after that. I sent her a message on Christmas day wishing her well and was honestly expecting to have a dialogue or something of that sort. Instead I got radio silence. I checked after a couple more weeks went by and she hadn't posted online since the post I mentioned above. I got a bit worried that she might have done something drastic, but stopped and realized she's pulled stunts like this before to get us to worry and reach out to her, so I dropped it, figuring she'd reach out when she was ready to give up the act.\nWell one of my brothers birthdays, as well as my own, have come and gone. Still no word from her. Almost 4 1/2 months later and still no updates or more woe is me posts. It looks like she might have finally taken a needed break from social media.\nOr does it? I got a text from my brother the other day asking if I'd seen her newest post about us. I hadn't, and when I looked, it wasn't showing up for me. It didn't show up when my SO looked either. I'm honestly surprised she managed to find the option to hide posts, but not too surprised as she didn't manage it correctly. She blocked me and my SO from seeing it, as well as my brother, but she didn't block his fianc\u00e9e from seeing it. \nIt was more of the same. She'd give her dying breath for us but we apparently couldn't give two shits, etc, etc, and not to bother with Mother's day.\nShe couldn't be bothered to reach out for Christmas, New Year's, any of our birthdays, or Easter, or to check on her children in the middle of a global pandemic, but still wants to make woe is me posts on FB? I don't know if it's meant to be her checkmate in a game of 4D chess or something. But whatever, go off Karen.\nMy brother invited me to be his best man at his wedding recently, as well! Though I've a feeling she won't be attending. My SO and I have also discussed it and after her stunt here she won't be coming to our wedding in the future either.

We let her come over because we assumed she was taking care of herself, her immune system is shot because she had cancer 9-10 years ago, it was a false sense of security that made me feel like \u201cwell if she\u2019s not scared I guess it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nI need to mention we\u2019re moving next weekend. We\u2019re moving an hour and a half away. Also need to mention that MIL lives with SIL and her 2 kids.\nFast forward to last week, she came over 3 freakin days in a row THEN invited us for dinner on the 4th day. As she said \u201cI need to get all the time in while I can.\u201d However during those 4 days my anxiety built up questioning if this is safe. I had to go to Target to pickup a DRIVE UP order, I\u2019m not going inside, MIL says \u201coh you & SIL should be Target buddies she goes all the time\u201d \u201cwell I\u2019m just picking up an order real quick\u201d \u201coh no she just walks around because she\u2019s bored.\u201d Ugh. Day 4 we went over there for dinner but the whole time I was on edge SIL told me she doesn\u2019t take a list when she goes to the grocery store so she takes forever and prior to dinner she went to 4 different stores looking for everything she needed. I found out SIL lets her baby daddy come over (he\u2019s a gang dude so who knows how many people he comes into contact with, he\u2019s definitely the type who\u2019s probably gone to parties), SIL goes over to see her BF who\u2019s BROTHER has COVID-19 but MIL assured \u201che doesn\u2019t see him though.\u201d After that my husband and I talked in disbelief that MIL is not in fact protecting herself like we thought. \nThe day after that the local bakery posted that 2-3 employees tested positive for the virus. The bakery is next to the liquor store MIL claimed she hasn\u2019t gone to the liquor store (she would go often to get lottery tickets and talk to her friend) but we called her to ask & she said \u201cI just go to hangout I don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d By this point my blood was boiling and panic was setting in.\nThat same day it was brought to my attention that my blood pressure medicine can make me more susceptible to the virus so all along thinking we had to watch out for MIL it\u2019s me who I need to watch it for. After that I spent the whole week crying and holding my kids, terrified. Me and husband decided to quarantine for two weeks until we move, so from the time we last saw her till the day we move it\u2019ll be exactly 2 weeks.\nWhich brings us to this weekend. Friday MIL calls husband asking to drink he says no. She calls him and says \u201cwell you know tomorrow we\u2019re having a BBQ because Grandma and Aunt and Uncle want to see you before you go so are you guys coming?\u201d he explains that we\u2019re not going to be around people this last week he asked her \u201cwell has Bob (divorced FIL who works in a warehouse) been over?\u201d and DESPITE SAYING NO LAST WEEK she goes \u201che hassss...\u201d Ugh. He says we\u2019re not coming and she just goes \u201cfine I\u2019ll tell grandma you\u2019re not coming BYE\u201d NOW GRANDMA CALLS and tries explaining \u201cwe\u2019ll all wear masks, we won\u2019t go by each other I haven\u2019t been out of the house for 6 weeks you\u2019ll be fine\u201d he says it doesn\u2019t work like that Bob and other baby daddy have been over, SIL goes out, it\u2019s not safe. On top of it we\u2019re moving! With kids! We don\u2019t have time to hangout and party!\nSo yesterday was the BBQ, MIL posted videos NO FUCKING MASKS, everyone sitting next to each other, my anxiety from last week has finally subsided I\u2019m not going back there. Yesterday we FaceTimed Grandma and after the call Grandma only paused the video so we heard MIL going off \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they have to move they could\u2019ve gotten a 1st floor what about me?! I only have one son\u201d  We\u2019re moving into a BLESSED situation, my mom had an accident that put her life into perspective so she\u2019s giving us her house, I have a bone disease my legs HURT I\u2019m on a 3rd floor with two kids I can barely get them outside for walks or to play now they\u2019ll have a big backyard to play in one step to get outside in a quiet, safe suburb. So that was a definite WTF moment.\nThen throughout the night MIL kept calling and texting while half in the bag. She cried that she won\u2019t be able to see us before we leave and doesn\u2019t understand how we can be so cruel. She told husband \u201cI have a heart and you guys don\u2019t.\u201d Husband tries diffusing the situation by assuring her once this over we\u2019ll visit but right now it\u2019s not safe to be around since she hasn\u2019t followed social distancing guidelines. Am I being totally unreasonable? Am I overreacting? I think am I being hypocritical since husband still has to work (the company made a lot of changes to keep the office safe) but then I think that\u2019s already a risk that can\u2019t be avoided why add more risk? I\u2019m a pushover and I feel for her but I\u2019m terrified for myself.

I was a little iffy on meeting them so quick but SO assured me it would be fine. They owned a business where they basically contract employees for special events. BF asked me if I would work with him on the week we met. It was a music festival, so I thought, this should be fun so why the heck not.\nOn the day of, we were in no rush to get there since we were on the afternoon shift and we were kind of extra employees in case the booth got extra busy. We finally get there, and JNFIL directs me to a parking space. He is noticeably angry, albeit quietly. I brushed it off as a personality quirk. \nWe get to the booth and I say hi to JNMIL, SIL, and the owner of the booth. Immediately, SIL pulls us to the back to \u2018get our IDs\u2019.

She is also pretty chill, but in the FOG). MIL tells me, \"We usually aren't this crazy!!!!\" (Note: What a freaking lie)\nThe rest of the night is pretty uneventful. The only other thing that was odd to me was MIL was supposed to teach me a position but she straight up ignored me. So, I asked the owner if I could learn the software he was using as a way to get out of that awkwardness. \nWould any of ya\u2019ll noticed red flags at this point, or had similar experiences?

Cause I have the immune system of an amoeba it doesn\u2019t work for anything, hubby has been extra aware of himself anytime he\u2019s had to go out like for groceries. My MIL T-T is a nurse and for the most part has done well with staying away and if she buys something she has put it in the trunk for him to get himself from there.\nWell my D(ear)H has recently gotten sick with something none covid related it was an organ issue and had to have surgery. T-T outside of her usual hypochondria and attention seeking was pretty good. We can deal with the phone calls after all by zoning out and into something else and she only has hubby\u2019s number so he deals with all of it like a pro. Now since we are both disabled and Covid has made his current options nil DH has had to ask T-T for some help. She was always good about it and kept her distance. Mind you she was on a list for no covid patients at all while working per her requesting it as she didn\u2019t need or want the pay increase her hospital was offering. \nSo hubby was healing at home fine. Me and the kids were super happy to have him home. Well we noticed something was wrong. He had some swelling and redness around the incision but it could of been nothing because of what his surgery was. However to be safe DH called the hospital and they told him to come back in. Well it turns out the probably nothing was a pretty bad infection. He\u2019s been in the hospital for 3 days now with still no antibiotics for his infection or really answers for a plan of what to do. \nProblem is hubby left for the hospital the second time, before he and anyone else could go food shopping due to his injuries. So he in his drug induced state asked his mom to grab groceries for us and gave her the list he used for himself last time. T-T of course had to call him for everything, including which brand of there were options or if a dozen eggs meant a dozen or a dozen and a half. \nThe problem came when it came time for her to drop things off. She called hubby to let him know she would be an hour. Since it was so late I had ordered food for the kids. Problem came that she showed up 45 minutes early. So I had grabbed the food only to have her show up. I quickly told hubby to let her know I\u2019d be out soon via the bookface messenger. But I made plates for the kids so that they didn\u2019t try and help themselves. Once I got to my front door guess who was there. T-T. She informed me that the neighbors had let her in (no idea which ones) as our complex is locked from visitors. She then proceeded to just waltz in and talk to me about everything. I half-tuned her out and just focused on getting the food in, while trying to keep my 4 year old and 6 year old from rushing at her to give her hugs as they missed her. The 6 year old was easy as I just reminded her that there was a sickness going around and she decided her food was better. However I had to keep reminding my 4 year old not to get close. T-T didn\u2019t help by constantly telling her how she misses her and wanted a hug so bad. \nAs she finally pulled the last grocery from her cart T-T starts hacking up a lung and I of course look at her a bit scared. She laughed and told me she had been working with covid patients but I shouldn\u2019t worry since the last one was 3 days ago before her prep landed vacation had kicked in. That it was just her face mask making her cough.\nI probably looked like a deer in the headlights because suddenly she was in a rush to leave. \nAnd now I am just furious. She didn\u2019t tell us she had started working with covid patients, and now that she is she suddenly stops doing her routine with us to keep distance and instead came into my apartment. Took off her mask and coughed all over everything. FML\nIf any of us get Covid I am going to blame her. But now I am deep into a bottle of wine terrified that my husband who just had a major infection after a major surgery might get covid and I don\u2019t know how his body will handle that on top of all the other shit.\nTo top this off we are being billed 12k by the apartment because they think our kids activated the fire sprinkler in their room almost a year ago., we talked to a lawyer and we are pretty much stuck with the bill we could argue to lower it but there is a good chance we wouldn\u2019t lower it more than a lawyer would cost. And my husband has no insurance because of being unemployed and welfare giving us the run around for 2.5 years. \nThis week just sucks and T-T just had to risk my families health to top it all off. I need more wine.\n\n"}, {"title": "Wedding 1 year on  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "71", "comments": "10", "content": "Tomorrow is our first wedding anniversary!

She knows I do not speak it yet continues to write to me in her language.  I usually translate her messages with an online translator and then get my husband to check my reply which takes ages. Lately, there have been work pressures, health issues and my oldest has speech delays so lots of therapy - stressful times. Then out of the blue I get a long email mainly where she talks about herself and that is bored in quarantine (how presumptuous!) and asks me to send her photos of the kids (that's mainly why she writes). She never really asks me how I am doing or even how the kids are - it's all me, me and me LOL\nThe other day I replied in English but then got a long email in her language again...okaaay. So do you think I need to reply to her in her language just to keep the peace? what do you suggest? I guess I am trying to avoid any conflict with her as she is prone to overdramatizing any situation.

To recap mil was sending many messages via the box of faces because I\u2019ve come down with covid.  Since then I\u2019ve ignored her, and the messages for the most part have slowed and even stopped. Until we had to retest our two year old because he\u2019s got a cough. (Still waiting on results - I\u2019m quarantined in the basement with him to keep him separate from everyone else - I\u2019m supposed to not be contagious anymore as I\u2019m almost three weeks post first symptom, but I\u2019m exhausted and still not feeling well)\nSo two evenings ago, after hitting the testing center with the toddler, I received another message from her. Of course I do. But she starts it with an affectionate address - \u201cHi Love, ......\u201d and I\u2019m just grossed out for so many reasons. \nOne - we do NOT have a close relationship.  Last time she sent me a message was when I was in the hospital last summer (donated part of my liver and suddenly she\u2019s messaging me again). time before that was Christmas months before, and before that it was the Christmas two years ago.   So. You can see. Not. Close.  (There were emails between us a few times last summer as she gave a fauxpology for everything that could have possibly offended me.  Everything except the things I directly told her I wanted apologies for)\nTwo - Love is what I call my husband.  And what he calls me. I would never use that term of endearment for anyone else. Not a child. And not a parent. And I find it very disconcerting for her to be using it towards me.  I call my kids Hon, babe, sweetie, even goober and brat. But never love. \nI\u2019ve ignored OSN for the most part. And I just look the other way when she drives me nuts because I have zero intention of giving her any F@cks.  But this creeps me out and I feel I need to say something. But the truth is no matter how polite I would be this will be a bee in her bonnet.   So. To send or not to send a reply?   I honestly believe in a policy of ignore is best, but I\u2019m so annoyed that I\u2019m considering breaking that rule.

(self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "75", "comments": "39", "content": "Sorry for the incoming wall of text, I really wish I'd found this subreddit earlier on or it could have saved me a lot of grief.  I've been on the fence about posting about my situation, but I feel like I need to get this off my chest and I'm sure a lot of you here can relate..  Advice is always welcome too.  \nThings started off well, I got along with my boyfriends family and didn't notice too many red flags at the start, to be fair though my MIL doesn't speak perfect English and my GMIL doesn't speak any at all(I don't speak their language, other than a few words/phrases).  The problems started when I found out I was pregnant.  I had one small benign issue in the first trimester, otherwise it was a model pregnancy.  I've been a runner since I was in high school, and continued that trend while pregnant (With the blessing of my doctor and OBGYN of course).  My MIL would NOT stop talking about it and telling me to stop doing it.  Every time I'd shut her down by saying she wasn't a doctor and both myself and my partner had made absolute sure it wouldn't harm the baby and consulted my doctor, several times, about it.  That didn't stop her.  It culminated in her cornering me in my bathroom, body blocking me from leaving and telling me to stop running.  I was firm and told her I wasn't going to stop and would continue doing so regardless of her opinion.  I ran up until the 8th month of pregnancy before switching to walking, and I could tell she wasn't happy about it.  \nWe lived in her house for the time being with GMIL and she lived on the other side of the country with her boyfriend, but insisted on living with us (against my wishes as I'm a very shy, private person and wanted as few people around as possible at first) for three months, the tail end of my pregnancy and the first month or so my daughter was with us.  During that time I had to hear tons of unsolicited, worthless advice.  I was reprimanded for:\n+Running\n+Sitting on the stone steps outside the house.  I would wait for my SO to get home from work every day.  Apparently doing this would make my 'girl parts' cold and the baby would come out.  GMIL full on yelled at me about this one.  I ignored it.\n+Wanting my SO in the delivery room.  I had to hear about this one for MONTHS because no one was in the delivery room with MIL when she had her baby.  Luckily my SO told her it was none of her business said it was my decision.\n+She told us not to let our daughter sit up even though she had reflux, because 'babies don't have bones' and her spine would grow crooked\nAfter my daughter was born things cooled off with MIL and GMIL took over the insanity, likely because the former went back home and the latter lived with us.  Any time my gentle, patient, 18 year old cat would even be near the baby GMIL would freak out and shoo her/hiss at her/nudge her away even though we told her to leave the cat alone (We never left them alone unsupervised regardless of my cats gentle disposition but I still wanted to encourage my cat's curiosity about the baby).  It was a daily fight, for months, before I witnessed GMIL BOOT my frail, senior cat when she wasn't even close to the baby.  I lost my shit and it resulted in a huge, blow up fight between everyone.  I had enough and threatened to leave because of that and the other problems.\nGMIL:\n+Told my boyfriend I was being rude and disrespectful and basically a horrible person..  All because I was leaning my head in my hands on the table and was looking down at my daughter who was sitting in my lap while I had a severe migraine.\n+Would yell at me through the bedroom door while I had baby down for a nap, and accused me of 'hiding the baby' from her even though I made sure she had time with her through the day and she got to see her when SO came home from work.  nevermind that my daughter was newborn and would sleep most of the day.\n+Yelled at me for a solid five minutes for 'taking the baby away', I had just taken the baby's activity mat downstairs to wash, the baby wasn't even with me and was napping in her bassinet.  The yelling continued when my daughter woke up and I went downstairs to fold laundry.\n+Would tell family members behind my back that I was hiding the baby from her..  Even though she got to see her multiple times daily and saw her more than anyone else.\n+Would make rude comments under her breath, and again, yell at me while I was just standing in the kitchen.  She expected me to cook all her meals and would lose her mind if I didn't.\n+Slammed doors and would engage in heated, yelling matches with SO over the baby\n+Yanked a teething toy out of my 3 month old daughters hands/mouth, she was getting her first teeth in, making my daughter cry.  Because it was made of cloth and a baby shouldn't have cloth toys according to her..  \nI started avoiding the woman at all costs because of the drama and nastiness and basically lived in the basement after she kicked my cat.  After that incident SO and I made plans to move out, and thankfully, ended up finding a house of our own..  But it needed renovations so moving was a few months off.  I clung to that thought.  \nWhen MIL came to visit things started escalating between her and I.  She and GMIL would barge into my bedroom without knocking or if they did knock wouldn't wait for an answer.  I would put the baby down to nap in there and both of them woke her up.  Literally all  I did was ask SO to tell them (Because of MIL's broken english and GMIL's non existent English) to knock first and wait for an answer before coming in.  That's it.  It became WW3 with MIL.  She accused us of being dramatic, saying we're making a big deal out of things..  We were respectful and just mentioned it in passing.  MIL waited until SO was at work to ask to speak with me, she sat me down and the first words out of her mouth were \"Don't be like *Partner's ex-wife's name*\".  I don't think that's a great start to a constructive conversation.  She went on to accuse me of trying to come between SO and MIL and GMIL, saying I was breaking them apart.  Because I asked them to knock on a door and wait.  That's it.  She went on to say that she's a happy person, perfect, and her and GMIL are both happy perfect people that never hurt anyone.  It was a five minute monologue on how great her and GMIL are, before I cut her off to say that nobody's perfect and that she was making a big deal out of a very small request.  Once she started accusing me of trying to break the family apart over common courtesy I put an end to the conversation, told her she was being ridiculous and dramatic over nothing and that I wouldn't participate in a conversation where I'm being made out to be a villain for no reason.  I wouldn't let her talk to me like that, especially not in front of my daughter.  So I left the room with DD.  \nIt didn't get better from there.  MIL is a very educated woman and trilingual, but common sense escapes her.  She dumped drain cleaner into our washer because she didn't bother reading the label on the jug..  She then asked to use my detergent, which was fine and I didn't mind, but it was one of those heavy jugs and for some reason she brought it into the baby proofed basement, left it on a table within our daughters reach.  DD DID manage to pull it off the table, luckily it just missed her foot.\nThe plan was to move into our home and MIL and GMIL would live together.  When we started renovating our house MIL came with us, to check out the property and watch the baby while we worked.  \nThe first night SO was setting up the alarm system and it went off, it's extremely loud.  MIL brought the baby right into the room with alarm blaring, I had to yell at her three times to get the baby out of there before she finally listened.  My SO saw the whole thing through the patio door and came in and gave his mother hell, I hadn't said a word and all of a sudden MIL starts saying that I'm making an enemy of her..  I was shocked and didn't know what to say because I wasn't even participating in the conversation.  I defended myself, told her I honestly didn't know what her problem was or why she was even talking to me that way, collected my daughter and left the room while the two of them continued arguing.  \nAfter that any time MIL would receive criticism she'd try to turn things around on me, even if I had nothing to do with the situation.  Twice she was supposed to be watching the baby and was so engrossed in a phone call she didn't notice my daughter get out of the play area and start climbing the stairs, and then climbing a chair.  Luckily both SO and I stopped what we were doing to see how long it would take MIL to notice baby doing dangerous things..  She didn't.  We had to say something both times.  \nThe worst incident came after..  I was already apprehensive about letting MIL watch my daughter, but we were low on time.  SO and I were painting while MIL watched our daughter upstairs, suddenly we heard an ear-piercing, pain-filled scream.  SO ran upstairs while I dropped my paint roller and followed right after.  DD was screaming in pain at the top of her lungs, the loudest I'd ever heard her cry, and MIL was playing it off.  She said DD was hungry or tired and nothing happened.  Bullshit nothing happened.  I had to yell at MIL to give me my baby because at first she refused to give her to me.  I tried to soothe her while we kept asking MIL what happened, but she kept saying nothing.  It was about five minutes of detective work before we figured out that MIL had smashed baby's fingers in the closet doors(unintentionally, but she still would've known she did it)..  I was livid.  She could have been honest and I could have run and put DD's hurt fingers under cold water..  Instead SO and I had to play Sherlock Holmes while our daughter screamed in pain.  Luckily her fingers were swollen, red, but otherwise okay.  The whole time however MIL was saying it was nothing and that it was okay because, \"*my name* had pinched her fingers in a desk drawer\"..  Which never happened.  That made me even more mad.  \nTo this day she still refuses to take responsibility for what happened, and STILL says nothing happened and the baby was just hungry.  I put my foot down and refused to let her watch DD ever again, unsupervised.  It did cause an argument between SO and I but i was firm since we gave her multiple chances.  Not to mention, it WILL happen again because MIL can't take responsibility for her actions.  \nShe was even in a car accident where she was at a stoplight behind someone, bent over to pick up lipstick she dropped and rear ended the car infront of her..  She says it wasn't her fault at all.  \nShe went back home after that incident and things settled..  Until her next visit.  This time, since I wouldn't let her have DD on her own she would take DD out of the room without my knowledge.  Naturally, I noticed pretty quickly and it made me mad.  I'm not a confrontational person so other than telling her not to do that and ask me before she takes DD out of the room, especially when I'm watching her, I didn't speak with her much.  One morning though MIL was up super early and banging around in the kitchen, to the point where she woke up the baby.  All SO did was ask her to wait to be loud in the kitchen until DD was up..  Once again, all hell broke loose.  I'm talking top of the lungs screaming, yelling, insults being thrown and MIL telling us to get out of her house.  My SO is not a rude person and literally just asked her politely to wait, because DD gets grumpy when she's woken up early/woken up from her nap.  She stewed for hours making comments under her breath, telling me that she knows what she wants but she's not going to tell me but she has made up her mind about it..  Meanwhile I had no idea what she was talking about.  Then she blew up at SO.  I grabbed the baby and took her away from the complete insanity, set her in the basement, and ran up to grab SO because MIL and GMIL had him cornered in the upstairs hallway..  All I did was yell at him to come away, that they were being absolutely crazy and I grabbed his arm to pull him way from them.  \nThat was when MIL slapped me with the clothes she was holding.  It didn't hurt, and it wasn't hard, but it definitely crossed a line.  I usually keep to myself, and I've never even dreamed of hitting anyone with anything, for any reason..  I was shocked.   I grabbed my SO, took him downstairs, and we just sat there talking about how absolutely insane it was.  I was shaking.  Hitting is just unacceptable.  We completely avoided MIL for the rest of the stay, even though she tried to play it off like nothing happened.  SO told her that hitting me wasn't okay, and her exact words were, \"It's not a big deal.  It's okay because we're family.\"  \nWhat.  The.  Hell.  And this woman CAN be nice, I actually enjoyed her company before I found out I was pregnant but this has gone to a whole new level of crazy.  So I'm wondering..  How do I have a relationship with this woman?  How do I handle all this?  And most importantly, how do I let it all go?  Between MIL and GMIL I feel like the last year has been a complete nightmare when I should have been celebrating being a new mom.  \nWe have moved in the meantime and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders..  But MIL still wants to visit and actually thinks she'll watch DD during the week when I go back to work..  And will also have her for Summer vacations.  I told SO over my dead body.

Her immediate response was \u201cit better not be flowers\u201d. \nNow - she does have two cats, and as the owner of a cat who will eat any plant like substance even if it makes him puke, I understand. But - she admitted she could find somewhere to put them where the cats can\u2019t get them. Then she called me an idiot for getting her flowers. Not a single thank you for thinking of her.

I should point out that our state remains under a stay at home order. So, she apparently expected we would drive over an hour to I guess sit outside 6 feet apart? She lives in a tiny mobile home so it would be impossible to go inside. I told her that we would need to go to the bathroom and she said we could go outside \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. She then accused of us getting together with our friends, which is 100% not true, since our stay at home order we have only done video calls with our friends.

Luckily the 4 of us have been good about shooting her down. We live in NYC, which is obviously a hot spot, and FMIL+FFIL live way out in the burbs. FMIL's only identity is being a mother - she has nothing else going on in her life even though her kids have been out of the house for 6+ years. On Easter she BEGGED us all to come over and threw a huge temper tantrum when we didn't. Future-SIL talked her down but apparently it wasn't pretty.

After my younger sister and brother were born, she lavished attention on them, they could do no wrong. When they made messes around the house, I had to clean them up. If my brother or sister stole, broke, destroyed anything, it couldn't be them, it had always been me. If I got good grades, awards, won trophies, they didn't matter. I never received support or even an \"I love you\" from the lips of my mother.\nMy mother had even gotten to the point of being physically and emotionally abusive if I didn't bow to my mother's will. If I didn't clean up the mess my siblings made, I was hit or screamed at. If she was angry because I didn't buy into her bull, she would break me down. I learned very quickly how to develop a tough skin on the outside and a soft broken person on the inside.\nEven now, my mother tries to manipulate my spouse against me, showing them favoritism and telling my spouse that she would rather have my spouse than me. Her words precisely were: \"If you and him break up, I am keeping you. I would rather have you.\" In the past she manipulated my siblings against me. Now she was trying with my own spouse. My spouse, thankfully, didn't buy into that. My spouse told my mom to knock it off but of course, she didn't.\nWhen my younger sister and brother began to have children with their partners, my mother bent her affections, manipulations harder with my siblings. The older I get without kids, the more my mother ignores me. She throws attention at my younger siblings and, their children but, ignores me completely with a \"I love my fur babies too.\" I don't let it control me but it still hurts. My value as her child shouldn't be dependent on if my spouse and I can procreate. Sadly neither of us can have children and we are too broke to adopt. \nI don't know what to do anymore.

(self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "46", "comments": "50", "content": "Warning: This will be a long post!\nSummary: Been living with very inconsiderate+traditional Pakistani in-laws for the past 6 years! Husband and I both born and raised in Canada, practising Muslims. My Asian/Mauritian family are not traditional or into the culture,  so this has all been a lot for me to handle. We are now in a position to get our own place and are looking at properties about a half hour away, but I fear my in-laws won't leave us alone and will intensify their level of interference if/when we have children. Hoping to hear from other desi women about their experiences after moving out and having kids etc. I'm feeling rather burnt out and after having some time alone during quarantine and realising how much stress they have added to my life, I'm wondering whether I should run now and get away from this marriage before we commit to a house and kids, so I don't ever have to deal with them again, or stick it out if things will get better. My husband (who I do still love unfortunately) has promised things will be different but has always been rather passive or tried to make me give in to MIL's wishes to keep her happy, so I don't know if things will get better in the future as I've not seen much evidence. Also as a spoilt South Asian mamas boy, I've found he is a bit of a slacker. It has affected every aspect of our marriage and I want to be able to be a good wife and someday mom but finding it difficult to see how with the way things are currently.\nI've always been against living with the in-laws but husband convinced me to try it for a short while so we could save to buy rather than \"wasting\" money on rent. It was meant to be 1-2 years MAX even though to start with I said I'd do no more than 6 months. Reassured me his family were \"cool\" (they think they are \"modern\" but they are definitely not - all this means is the females born into their family are allowed to do whatever the hell they want but any female that marries into their family must adhere to their weird traditions). I discovered his extended family are a huge family of cousins who have married cousins who have married cousins so they're all related to each other by blood one way or another and they all have tons of kids so there's a LOT of them (they consider 2nd/3rd/4th cousins to be \"very close family\" so I have had to put up with not just MIL but extended family at times too (our wedding guest list was another story and mama's boy caved and let MIL invite 3 x the no. of our guests - it was like a CIRCUS on the day. His uncouth family would not stay seated, or quieten down for my siblings and friends' speeches, let their kids photobomb and run crazy and ruin our wedding cake and his adult relatives started arguing with each other and our DJ because they wanted to hear what THEY enjoyed).\nSome examples of what I've had to put up with while my in-laws have tried to mold me into their idea of a perfect Pakistani  wife (husband passive/doesn't like getting involved): MIL telling me about the cousins her darling son could have married, using SILs as her bulldogs to spy/question/intimidate me if she couldn't get through to me, constant pressure from MIL and MILs relatives/friends to produce grandchildren that she could raise while I went back to work full-time because she was bored, commenting on my clothing and appearance - apparently I wasn't dressing up enough at home! (husband's female relatives are all desi wannabe insta baddies when they leave the house whose life ambitions are to marry a rich badboy with no inlaws) - my SILs spend the day in pjs but as the \"bahu\" there are different expectations for me! MIL and SILs helping themselves to my belongings when I have been at work (I have sometimes gotten home to find MIL wearing my clothes - this eventually stopped after about a year - I mean, why does anyone even need to be put in that situation. Is this not basic human decency/common sense/basic boundaries?) Letting extended family sleep in our bedroom if we went away. Insisting on taking care of our area of the house (separate entrance but they have access/key, not separate kitchen, so MIL likes to hover around giving me pointers if I'm ever cooking) while we've been at work \"to make our lives easier\" but then complaining about any mess we happened to have left behind rushing to get ready in the morning and THEN demanding we return the favour over the weekends yet she'd then critique my work as it wasn't up to her standards (I think this is an excuse to rifle through our things - MIL knows exactly where to find everything I own), pressuring me to learn their language, forcing me to visit random relatives over weekends (I work all week and am exhausted by the weekend), frequently having extended family over and forcing me to dress up and waste my time sitting with them, serving them food and tea, despite not understanding the language, female relatives insulting me under the guise of a joke, badmouthing me for apparently not spending enough time with them during the holidays/celebrations and daring to spend time with my own family, taking half of husband's monthly salary and then trying to make me contribute to household expenses too (I already buy my own clothes and food, I think they tried and succeeded in financially strangling us to delay us moving out in the hopes we would have a child and be stuck with them for longer), pushing their sexist gender roles on everyone and insisting men don't do any housework as it's \"a woman's job\" - MIL would even go so far as to laugh if she saw my husband helping me out and grab dishes off him and mock him saying \"are you a woman? hahah\", if anything bad happened, even SILs blame evil eye - like no you caught a f***n cold, you have not been cursed by a jealous witch *sigh* the list could go on forever but these are a few examples.\nThere was also the manipulation with the fake illnesses/fainting like something out of a Pakistani drama, and the most scary was the way she talked about my future kids in such a possessive way - that they would spend most of their time with her, that she would raise my  \"son\" (because they are the type of people who favour boys over girls so naturally it had to be a son). \nI was extremely insecure and put up with it this long because I love my husband and partly because I was terrified of divorce and  the whatifs about my future, but I don't know if a possible lifetime of having to shield myself and my kids from their interference is worth it. \nEdited to add: \nI've never had an outright argument with my in-laws thank God, because even when they've been nasty they've dressed it up and said offensive things in a sickly sweet/loving tone. It's an art only South Asian ILs can perfect.\nI should add there have been times where MIL has done nice things such as make me food when I was sick, or buy me gifts for holidays/for large celebrations, but it still worries me that all the above happened and my privacy was taken away.\nWhen they've been snidy/patronising I've chosen to bite my tongue and not explode because I didn't want it to get ugly and give them ammo to call me disrespectful etc. FIL doesn't usually get involved but I think has seen the impact MILs ways have had and is encouraging us to move and get on with our lives and has offered to help financially. Problem is he's not in the best health and not going to be around forever and when he passes, my MIL will run wild with her huge family!\nI've spent a great deal of time escaping to my mom's or dad's when I needed peace, for days, sometimes weeks at a time. This wasn't ideal for our marriage obviously as it meant a lot of time apart. When we have our own home, I don't know if we'll have the same peace if they feel like they can just turn up when they like.\nI was not the best wife I could be either because I was so stressed out. This led to issues with libido, intimacy, short periods of separation etc. My husband was also supportive during bad periods of my life and so I feel like I sort of owe him. This is why I still feel like giving the marriage a shot as my husband was patient during those times. \nWe are looking at properties about a half hour away in a neighbouring city but I worry that the MIL will still find excuses to come stay with us and be overbearing and take over raising my child.\n\n"}, {"title": "My JNMom is once again hijacking career ideas  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "23", "comments": "2", "content": "Growing up both of my JNparents were negative on what we (their kids) wanted to do as adults.

My JNM would be passive about his comments not actually saying he was wrong and even add back handed comments. Such as \"If you do want that you have to work harder at  [insert subject] or else you will not be able to. You have to just do better [insert subject], ok?\"\nI'm now an adult, married, with my own children and am trying to break the toxic cycle. Meanwhile my youngest siblings are still living with some of the same BS dynamics.   \nTalking to JNM today about a completely different subject. She mentions Sib #6 is getting ready for community college. Sib#6 isn't 100% sure what they want to do and has expressed interest in engineering along with a few other subjects. Engineering has been brought up for almost 2 years as well. JNM has issues with this. She said their interest is only for the money they could make not from true passion. She thinks they will fail and/or be unfulfilled because she doesn't see them \"tinker\" with objects, doing puzzles, or \"studying math on [their] own at all.\" She has told them they will fail and she wants them to be realistic. Sib#6 also has a chronic a condition that JNM is using as an excuse as to why it would make this degree difficult to obtain. She has already said this to Sib#6's face.\nThis \"you're gonna fail\" mentality been done with almost every single one of us in some way. I actually see where the degree would give Sib#6 a cushy desk job with great benefits if they follow through. We ended up getting into it. I asked her not to be negative about their interest in engineering, encourage core curriculum first, and let them work it out on their own. My suggestion is what started an argument.\n In the past my JNparents have argued degree options with us kids because they thought they knew better than us about what our interest are. JNo's do NOT pay toward our degrees. They offer housing and rides with some food. They expect rent to be paid to them, which is fair, but don't act like this is complete support toward our degrees. Paying rent makes you a tenant not a kid whose parents get to tell you what to do for making decisions on education/career.\n In this conversations she tried to take credit for some of us older kids successes that she was dissuasive of. She said how she can't offer the same support to Sib#6 as us older kids (only us older 3 have left the nest. So many toxic dynamics on this) so there is no time for them to explore themselves at college. Then tried to see if I would budge and see it from her point of view. Honestly, I can't.\nI'm seriously thinking, what JNM is gonna kick them out? Not get rent money from them? She's living on child support for the youngest kids and Sib#6 is about to be bumped off due to graduating this year. She went back to school herself since JNo's divorced, got a B.A., is now back in school for an A.S. and still doesn't have a job. Her whole college experience has been about her \"finding herself\" but godforbid a young adult out of high school wants to have a similar experience.

DH was out of town at that time due to a workshop with an exboss of him. \nWhen we were at the coffee place, MIL started lecturing me once again about how important it is for me to find a job that would match with her \"little prince\" working schedules, otherwise we would fail as a couple, as well as something which could make me earn good money so the little prince wouldn't be in charge of all the expenses (back then I was not even legally allowed to work but still I tried to apply for a couple of jobs). God knows the little money I get from DH I spend it on groceries only!\nAnyway, she always says she means well. After we had our coffee she gave me a ride back to our apartment and on our short way back she asked if DH already told me about the \"marriage\" contract (not a prenup), so evidently I answered: no. Then she acted a bit disappointed and started to explain:\n\"You know, my husband and I have worked so hard to have what we have and we want to protect our assets. We will inherit everything to our children, so when we die they'll get equal parts; but we're concerned if our son also dies, then you'd be getting part of our inheritance and then you will enjoy our hard work with ANOTHER MAN (bc everyone would be dead by then), so we want our assets to remain in the family (SIL's children). Therefore we need you to sign something after the wedding, not right away, but at some point\".\nI only responded: \"whatever makes you sleep at night\"...\nI asked DH about this and he just said it's not even important for him, but that IL's stated that if we don't sign it then he won't inherit anything.\nI haven't signed anything yet, so I'm pretty sure they're dying inside. Wtf, I don't want a cent from them ever,  but how the thing was addressed is what really still pisses me off...\nThanks for reading!

(self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "20", "comments": "11", "content": "This is my first time posting here. I've lurked for a while, because I can relate to lot of the MIL issues. My mom, who has been, for the most part, a JYmom, seems to be turning into a JN. Or maybe it's just my pregnancy hormones, I don't know. \nIt's hard because she is a really good grandma to our girls, and they're very close to her. \nFor starters, this has easily been the most difficult year of my life. In addition to the COVID-19 stuff, I'm 32 weeks pregnant with my third baby girl. Back in January, we found out that she has a chromosomal abnormality (luckily, it's a relatively mild one, but it can range from asymptomatic to mobility issues and intellectual disability). This has obviously been hard for me to come to terms with.\nWe live out of state due to my husband's career. Overall, living far away from family is definitely a blessing. \nLately, everything I talk about with her, she finds a way to criticize or second-guess. I'll give just a couple examples. We had planned to go to her house over spring break, but cancelled due to the virus. She just bought a plane ticket to my place instead, since that's apparently safer somehow. She was mad when I told her to cancel her flight, but did it anyway. She doesn't discuss issues when she's upset, she just gives the silent treatment until she's over it. Pretty healthy, right?\nI mentioned wanting to go to work part time when the baby is 6 months to a year old. To her, daycare is the worst thing ever. In my opinion, a baby needs a happy mom. Other than going back to school, I've been a stay at home mom for almost ten years. She of course said things like \"you won't want to throw your baby in daycare when she's that little\". My youngest started daycare at 3.5 when I went back to school full time. She loved it. It was a very nurturing environment. I guarantee she got more hugs and \"I love yous\" in her time there than I ever got as a child. So I don't understand how daycare is an inherently awful thing. \nBecause my pregnancy is considered high-risk, I see my OB as well as a MFM Dr. I mentioned going in for an ultrasound, and she questioned me as to whether it is safe for the baby to get so many ultrasounds. For one thing, obviously my doctor knows what the safest course of action is. Secondly, how is it helpful to potentially give me yet another thing to worry about?\nThe other day she mentioned wanting to fly out here soon. (She lives in a state that's been hit pretty hard). She asked if that was ok or if I would be too \"paranoid\". I don't think adherence to expert advice is paranoid, but I let that go. I just said I wasn't comfortable, given that this is already considered a high-risk pregnancy and we have two elementary age daughters. So of course now, she isn't speaking to me. \nMy OB has mentioned induction, because of all the uncertainty with this virus, and because I have suspected issues with my placenta that may cause it to stop working sooner than normal (hence the frequent growth ultrasounds and NST's). My mom wants to come here for the birth to watch our kids and meet the baby, but I think I'm just going to schedule the induction, and not tell anyone.  My husband can stay with our other kids, and I'll give birth alone. He's disappointed, but understands.  That seems like the least stressful option for me.\nI was really upset about this last night, and telling my husband that if one of our girls are ever in this position I would do everything in my power to support them, not throw a tantrum because I wasn't getting my way. I would ask what I could do to help, and then do that. Being in this position is so, so lonely. I have friends I can talk to, but no one that can relate to needing to prepare for a wide range of possible issues with our baby. Also everyone is obviously busy and overwhelmed with everything going on, so I don't want to burden anyone by constantly venting to them. That, along with homeschooling and being stuck at home for the time being, has really been hard. \nMy girls are amazing kids, and I hate so much that they've been seeing me cry. This is obviously hard on them, to not be able to see their friends or their teachers, to very likely have to cancel our summer vacation plans. Despite all of this, they are taking things in stride and are doing so well. I'm so proud of them.  I'm doing the best I can, but feel like it isn't enough. I guess I just feel like I need that support that a mom should provide, and it hurts that right now I can't get it.\n\n"}, {"title": "I\u2019m not visiting my MIL for Mother\u2019s Day  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "58", "comments": "22", "content": "I\u2019ve decided not to visit my MIL for Mother\u2019s Day.

I'm going to give a bit of background and we'll get into the juicy bits. I can't have one phone call can I? There's a bunch to unpack with this bitch.\nWe had an old pastor, as you do. He had kids, one a month younger than me( also female), a son the same age as my younger brother and then a third baby that came much much later. This is were things began, they were the weird homeschooling type Uber fundamental Christian the whole stick. My mom eventually ended up divorced during this time and me and my brother ran like dogs without leashes. I had developed severe issues that I just now got diagnosed 10 plus years later, besides the depression and anxiety. \nNeedless to say there was a family that followed the same pattern except for they had a girl one year older than me and a boy a year older than my brother. Being kids with not alot of options because they had exactly zero outside interaction besides the other family and we went to the same church, we were saddled into being friends. All three of us girls went to the same college and I'll summarize like this- older girl couldn't handle one rejection, dropped out and met some dude on tinder with kids and made him cut ties with them and got married after six months. Girl one month younger- stayed one semester and found the most desperate dude on campus and told him if he dated her that her dad would give him a job, and then dropped the fuck out after one semester saying her calling was to be mother and God would provide her money. Me- still in college and not giving a fuck, also single. \nWe all drifted apart, and I haven't talked to these two in over two years. I ran with a different crowd, and will eventually have a degree. Neither one has and lives off their parents. I was invited to both wedding, and at the time hadn't had or seen the slightest bit of communication from either, no texts or nothing for just barely two years at this point. They'll both extremely religious btw. \nThey grew up to be wives and I grew up to be.. what's the word? Ah, yes an asshole. Submissive and all that jazz, kinda turns my stomach. I declined to both weddings,but I'm guessing they figured out at the end of the day they didn't really make friends because only so many real people would but up with their shitty judgmental behavior. \nSure, I've ignored the Facebook comments about how because I'm not married at 20 I'll die alone and am not in God's will. I've ignored the constant jibes about how motherhood and biblical wifehood is a gift and that a degree won't fulfill me. The whole \"I know some of you couldn't come to the wedding so I live streamed it and I noticed some of you haven't watched tee-hee\" bullshit. \nThere's also one more thing, and now we get to my mom. The juicy bits. Those two while minor inconveniences, and hardly the major inconvenience that my mother poses. So remember how I mentioned that the pastor has a son? Yeah, you all see where this is going. I'll paraphrase the conversation.\nMom: So did you see the invites to (Pastors Son) high school graduation?\nMe: Yup, I don't think I'm going to be able to go. (I'm not fucking going.)\nMom: well he's surely looking handsome these days, have you ever considered dating him?\nShe's done this every single fucking time. This crazy bitch, keeps trying to set me up with this crazy ass boy who she approves of because he's Christian. Fuck my asshole, it's every time. \nMe: No, did you see his sister is pregnant? It's been what, three months since the wedding? \nMom: why didn't you go to that anyway? She could have set you up with a nice Christian boy that she knows, and have you decided what you're getting them for the baby?\nMe: no, it's not my baby to pay for. I didn't go to the wedding, and I'm not paying for something for someone who hasn't talked to me in like three years. \nNow, this bitch has been saying oh, god will provide for my baby and shit. It's not my fucking fertilized cumshot to pay for, and frankly, she's one of the most selfish naive people I've ever met. She has no idea on how to raise a baby. Somehow, I'm the bad guy because I realize I can't take care of myself, the stupid aloe plant I bought to keep alive and that I'm selfish and don't want to go without. No, no, at this point my mom has kinda a pissy tone. \nOkay, for both weddings I didn't go. I had ample opportunity to go. I told my mom I was sick, and we did have a death in the family, but I could have easily went. I was drunk both days instead, and I distinctly remember looking at the clock when both were getting married and was like \"I'm sure as hell gonna have more orgasms tonight that you\" and then got drink. You think I'm gonna tell my crazy mom that? No. Am I every going to say anything above about how I hate both girls? No. Also, that promise was 98% true on my end, because all women's pleasure is for men only according to them. Fuck em, I like diddling the Skittle. I don't care bout 'ringing the devil's doorbell '  and who cares if he comes knocking? They can get take their 1800 way of thinking and put it straight up their baby chute. \nMom: You know, I'm glad you're getting a degree... Could you at least consider going on one date with (pastors son?) You haven't met anyone yet, at all! Besides how will you be able to have babies?\nMe: babies are expensive. I am selfish. I like being alone. Mom, babies are expensive. I am perfectly fine being alone. I can't even take care of my stupid aloe plant, let alone maintain a relationship or a baby. Babies are harder than plants, I imagine. \nMom: all your friends are getting married, starting families! When is that going to happen for you? You need to be putting more effort into that!\nMe: they also going to live below the fucking poverty line because they're having a baby with a single minimum wage job, and one refuses to work even though she's capable. I don't want to live in debt. Babies need more resources that \"oh,god will provide\". \nShe then proceeded to turn to a murder that she had pestered me about at 3 am in the morning, but that's a whole nother post.

Anywho, I didn't think I'd be posting again, but this feels extremely therapeutic so here we are. Let's start from the top!\nMy MIL hasn't been TOO terrible, but being stuck with them for years and them receiving holier than thou treatment will make you question things. That's her behavior too, over the top nice. But of course as you can tell from my last post I get glimpses of another side of her that her son (DH) seems to be blind too. Or defends by saying \"she means well.\" If that was the case, she would listen and respect me when I tell her her behavior bothers me instead of being told not to be \"sensitive\" right? \nThis didn't become a problem for me until I got pregnant, my anxiety was through the roof and I felt I had to \"earn\" my keep here. So I cleaned, I washed his laundry, I'd make tea, etc. I done almost everything that was asked from me, except for cook. Which I had extreme anxiety about and made very very clear. \nOne day, after continuously being asked to take on more and more of the household chores, as she would just run off and do as she pleased, I just couldn't take it anymore. I was about 8 months pregnant and I broke down crying. \nShe had a habit, of dirtying up damn near every dish in the house while cooking. Since she KNEW she wouldn't be the one who had to wash them. This is when I knew there was another side to her, this holier than thou woman, blatantly LIED straight to DH face and mine saying she washed dishes every other day and I was just being sensitive. My jaw about hit the floor, I could NOT believe she would lie straight to his face like that. Because up until that point, I really believed she was a great person and we had gotten along well enough.. But of course, he immediately believed her instead of me. \nShe isn't terrible, like I said, but I wish more than anything someone else could see the side of her I do... Next time, I'll share the story of being accused of stealing from her and the \"ghost.\"\n\n"}, {"title": "I feel very anxious seeing Baby Snatcher MIL with my baby.

(I\u2019m better at being assertive now, thanks to the advice of this forum). Summary:\n1) once I was discharged after childbirth, she moved into our house temporarily to help with cooking and cleaning (which was very nice of her)\n2) within 3 days, she had told SO I was inconsiderate and a bad person, because I wasn\u2019t doing enough small talk with her and this made her feel unappreciated. SO told me he didn\u2019t like who I had become and I needed to change back to the chatty person I was before childbirth. This whole time I had been breastfeeding and looking after LO through the night etc. i explained to SO i was extremely tired from all this and also why do I need to prioritise small talk when I am looking after a tiny human. He asked me to try to be more chatty and also talked to MIL and explained she can just be a bit too chatty and overbearing. Things are a little strained after that but not too bad.\n3) MIL was holding my baby and I said I needed to breastfeed him. She refused to give him back until he started screaming.\n4) I told SO who then talked to MIL. \n5) the next day MIL badmouths SO and me to the baby, right in front of me, as a \u201cjoke\u201d\n6) final big incident: I\u2019m hovering over my baby in the dark, wondering why he is screaming yet has his eyes closed. MIL runs in and picks up the baby and makes to leave. I say, no wait, but she runs away with my baby down the stairs. When I go downstairs for dinner, she looks at me, smiling, still holding my baby, and says dinner is on the table. \n7) i am furious and tell SO. SO talks to MIL and says you can\u2019t snatch a baby from his mother. MIL makes up a lie to change the story, also says he\u2019s hurting her feelings by the way he\u2019s talking to her and says she is leaving, and remember that time Risingsea was mean and not chatty enough? SO doesn\u2019t stop her. Next morning she has dramatically packed every. Single. Tiny. Item. That is hers. She is crying and leaves. Later SO cries and calls her and says he is a bad son. MIL says she is still hurt.\n8) a few weeks later I guess MIL has \u201cforgiven\u201d SO. MIL says she wants to see grandbaby every Saturday. I say to SO let\u2019s do every 2nd Saturday.\n9) MIL comes over every 2nd Saturday and ignores me and plays with baby.\n10) covid so I\u2019m given a breather from MIL. She insists on weekly video calls and I hate seeing her face fill up the screen as she talks to the baby sitting on SO\u2019s lap. I realise seeing MIL with LO still makes me anxious she is going to snatch him away from me whenever she can in future and/or sabotage my parenting relationship with LO.\n11) i talk to SO about my anxiety. He said I can\u2019t avoid her forever. I ask if MIL ever said it was wrong to have taken LO from me. SO said no and that \u201cMIL was just trying to help\u201d. I said baby snatching is not helping. SO says \u201cit was only snatching from your perspective\u201d. I said it was snatching from any rational person\u2019s perspective. SO said \u201csure but MIL has never been rational\u201d.\nWhat would you do in my shoes?

I really need a place to vent out my anger. Yesterday, I made a post on another sub about what started all this drama. Basically, I gave my 7yo son a sip of wine, because he asked for it and I thought it could be a teachable moment about alcohol (I knew he wouldn't like the taste, and was hoping that would keep him away from it/quell his curiosity). MIL found out, as my son told her on a facetime, and was very upset. She thinks its going to cause my son to be an alcoholic, I'm a terrible parent, I drink too much, all that jazz. \nI talked with DH last night, we decided that he wouldn't facetime his mother with our son without me present. Also, decided that we would call her today and have a discussion on boundaries and not questioning how I parent. We tried to this morning, but it didn't go well. I explained my side of the situation once more, and let her know that I didn't want to shelter my son from things like alcohol so that he could have a healthy relationship with it when he gets older. But still, she did NOT understand. (As a side note, I don't know where all this anti-alcohol stuff is coming from.. everyone in her family also enjoys a casual drink, including her! But she's known to start drama and right now, I think she's bored). \nCouldn't go on with the facetime anymore, because she wasn't hearing what I was saying and just talking over me. So I ended by saying \"ok I have to go grocery shopping now, bye.\" It was true, but also I was using it to get out of the call. Looking back, I made a huge mistake in telling her that, but hindsight is 20/20 unfortunately. \nFast-forward, I'm done shopping, get back in the car, and open my phone to a string of texts from DH. MIL was AT THE HOUSE. during all this, with our son around?? I swear all I saw was red while I was driving home. I'm getting angry even typing this out now. \nI got home while she was still there and tried to keep my composure while demanding why she was at our house, to which she told me that she \"needed to see what was going on around here.\" Then, she said she was just getting going, and tried to scurry out. Oh, and while she was leaving, she said I should dump my wine out so my son couldn't get to it. I was crying at this point, I was so angry. DH told me afterwards that she had gone through the kitchen to see what alcohol we had (I bet if I didn't get home sooner, she would have thrown it away herself). \nI feel like I'm being crushed and controlled by this behavior. I don't want to be shamed in my own house for my choices. But standing up to her is scary, and like walking a thin line. I don't want to go NC, because my son has a relationship with her and FIL, but I don't know how to establish boundaries when she isn't willing to listen. \nFor context (because I know I'll get asked), MIL lives less than 10 minutes away, and we don't lock our door unless no one is home, which is how she got in.

Little bit of back story: Right before his birthday at the end of October, she texted him asking him to come for thanksgiving. No mention of me but that\u2019s normal. However it annoys DH that I am never included in any invitation, but honestly she doesn\u2019t care if I come or not. She doesn\u2019t really even talk to me when she does see me. DH had been pretty stressed at work during that time and wanted that 4 day weekend to be home. I am also in school so money has been tight for us and we really could not afford to put our dogs in the kennel. As a side note putting our dogs in the kennel always makes us a little anxious since last year our dog passed away while at the kennel. (I should mention not the kennels fault at all, his heart gave out and it was just a freak sad circumstance that left us heartbroken). So DH asked if we could bring the dogs, they have a screened in porch (they live in the south) that the dogs could sleep on at night, in kennels we would bring along with us. They are house trained, and don\u2019t chew on things they aren\u2019t supposed to. They are great dogs. Well, my MIL and FIL didn\u2019t like that idea and MIL shouted at DH that he was choosing the dogs over them. DH explained the situation of money and the kennel to them, and invited them to our house which is 5 hours away and told them that they could have thanksgiving here. MIL said that it was unacceptable that he doesn\u2019t come home more often, that this breaks her heart, that he is a terrible son for not wanting to come to his childhood home. MIL said it was boring at our house just hanging around the house, but we do the same thing at her house... so....? She said it\u2019s unfair they are always coming to our house, which they come twice or three times a year and DH goes to their house once a year or so. They are retired and DH works full time and I am in school full time. So it\u2019s easier for them to come to us. It\u2019s always been an issue which is weird. When she\u2019s here she complains our neighbors are too loud, it\u2019s too cold in the house, the bed is uncomfortable, and the dogs make too much noise. So we suggested they stay at a hotel and they have ever since. Well that is also an issue because why should they stay at a hotel? But if you\u2019re going to complain about everything in our house, why wouldn\u2019t we suggest it?!DH has had enough. We\u2019ve been together for almost 7 years at that point and the amount of times she\u2019s pulled this shit is unreal. MIL starts crying and telling DH that he is not a good son and if he was he would put her feelings above everyone else\u2019s. So thanksgiving came and went and we celebrated alone with Chinese takeout. Honestly it was great. Since October DH has had very limited contact with her because she\u2019s manipulative and a narcissist. Each time she has reached out she has called him a bad son, said things like he was raised better than this, the dogs shouldn\u2019t come before your parents, etc. She has texted and sent voicemails over the last few months, one that said DH needs to be careful with his high blood pressure and asthma during covid. He has neither of those things... what is she talking about? Every time she has sent an email or text he either responds with okay, or ignores them. She is just ripping him during these texts and voicemails, so why would he respond? \nToday he mowed the lawn, and came in to take a shower. While upstairs I get an email from him that is titled \u201cUS\u201d. I assume it\u2019s a funny post from reddit or ig because we send them to each other all the time. However, it was a email from his mom. In it she told him what a horrible son he was being for not talking to her for months. She wrote \u201cYou said you loved us. Was that a lie??\u201d Wtf, she sounds like a crazy ex girlfriend, but whatever. She kept on writing that the dogs were more important than them. Which to be fair they are to me, because they are our children and we can\u2019t have any of our own. She goes on to say that she has never been fond of dogs, especially our dogs and that she never will be. She said she felt sorry for him that he can\u2019t go a weekend without them. Which we can, and we have done since our dog passed. She goes on to say that he is hurting her heart and this is not who she raised. She is one of the worst people I have met and throughout the 6ish months they haven\u2019t been talking I haven\u2019t said a negative thing about her to him. She has said many negative things about me while we have been together. She\u2019s said these things to him, and to my family at my bridal shower, and to my face. She is a terrible person and my FIL just follows suit. I am honestly thrilled that DH is not talking to her, but it makes me mad that she can be so mean to her only child. She signs the email off as \u201cLife is short and YOU are wasting the time you could spend with us. Love you\u201d - screw you MIL. Our dogs are the best and way better than most people on this earth. It is your loss on your relationship with your son, not his.\n\n"}, {"title": "JNMom cries into my child when asked to quit feeding him pasta salad... At Hoss\u2019s.  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "671", "comments": "59", "content": "This happened a while ago, but it\u2019s the last time I was out and alone with JNMom. My area is about to have quarantine restrictions loosened days before Mother\u2019s Day so instead of anxiously thinking about that, I thought I\u2019d share this insanity. Also, Hoss\u2019s is a steak house/buffet, I\u2019m not sure if there are any outside of my state. \nI\u2019m soft, too soft and a people pleaser. This bites me in the ass sometimes but I rarely learn. Being the person I am I begrudgingly agreed to go out to eat with her with no third party to hold her accountable. \nI don\u2019t know why JNs have an obsession with being able to feed other people\u2019s children whatever they please, but it seems like a common occurrence. I got my son a plate of fruits and veggies from the salad bar, sprinkle some shredded cheese on there (because I\u2019m a cool mom) and figure I\u2019ll get him some cottage cheese after he makes an attempt at his healthy plate. I\u2019m not super strict on what he eats, mainly nothing too sugary and no French fries (this has been a point of contention since my son started trying foods, she seems to take it as a personal attack) but he has been teething and eating nothing but cheese and crackers for about 48 hours so I was desperate to get some fiber into this kid. \nImmediately this woman starts filling any empty spots on his plate with mayo covered pasta. Very nutritious. Not wanting her to start her shit I asked her not to add anymore until he ate most of what I gave him, explaining the teething and talking gently like I was trying to tame a tiger. \nShe huffs, but stops... For several minutes. As soon as he finished the pasta and actually started eating what I gave him she starts sneaking, yes, across the table from me and dropping single pastas, more into his plate.\nI tell, not ask, her to stop. \nThis woman huffs as loudly as she can, in a packed restaurant, says, \u201cFine! I\u2019ll stop corrupting him!\u201d\nI respond, \u201cI\u2019m seriously going to leave if you\u2019re going to act like this.\u201d\nShe seriously picks up my son from his high chair, clutches him to her chest and begins crying into him while whispering God knows what into his ear. In, once again... A packed restaurant. Like, how do you even react to that?\nAfter coming out of my shock I hiss whispered, \u201cPut him back.\u201d He ate a few more peas, I asked for my bill when my entree came out and bounced. \nThis was all after she told me that it\u2019s my fault he\u2019s not talking yet because I\u2019m teaching him baby sign language. So, fuck her.\nBonus pasta salad story: A few months later my cousin\u2019s son was having his first birthday party. I left my son with my JYSister to eat some pizza but of course that vulture swooped in. I must be invisible to her because as I walk back to the table I hear her whispering to my sister \u201cPasta salad!!\u201d No clue why the pasta salad obsession, probably just to be spiteful. JYS of course says no, stop it, as I drop off a baby sized piece of cake for DS before helping serve a few other people. Since I\u2019m invisible, mom starts feeding him the cake and whispering, \u201cSh! Don\u2019t tell her I gave you cake!\u201d\nJYSister just stares before telling her I, in fact, brought him the cake at the birthday party and if she doesn\u2019t stop being like that I\u2019m not going to let her be alone with him (lol that ship has long sailed).\nAnd those are the tales of the last time I was alone with her and the last time I was forced to be around her. I\u2019m stressed about what demands she\u2019ll have for Mother\u2019s Day but gotta stay strong. This is my kid, not her pasta salad receptacle. It feels so much better writing this stuff out than just replaying it on an anxious repeat.

(self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "45", "comments": "37", "content": "First of all I'm sorry for my English. It's not my native language. I've been with my wife for 11 years and we are married for 6 years. Since from the beginning of our marriage I hate my MIL. Because she is overly controlling, always yelling, narcissist, she had no education, and doesn't respect educated people, left from the primary school but knows everything and has idea on every topic and always forces her ideas.\nUp until now we have lived in faraway cities, she live in a city which is 800km away (500miles?) and she also lives in her village during summer time which is 1600km away (1000 miles). Since the beginning of our marriage, my wife insisted that I have to come with her to visit her family during winter in the city and during summer in her village. Whenever I visit them, her father is a good man, I like him and we have a good relationship with him, but her mother always yelling, always angry and always commenting on stuff.\nShe always calls me a word when she talks to me which is the slang way of saying man. For instance once she saw my socks which are only red nothing fancy and she said you are wearing gal socks (or bitch socks, she used the bad way of saying women in our language). And after that I didn't say anything and she said they are faggot socks. (My wife says she talks everyone like that, and I always say I don't want to be talked or called like that). When she says that stuff my wife was there and she smiles, then I yell her mother to speak properly she gets mad at me. When I tell her why didn't you say anything to your mother? She always says I speak to her privately, but nothing changes.\nYears passed, every year it's a problem for us to visit her and always a problem when she visits us. Because I hate her guts, I hate her yelling, I hate her knowing everything. I don't know how you call it, she is ignorant, she has no education, never worked in a job and get paid but she is alpha female?, she is narcissist. My wife has a brother and sister, they always fight with their mother and yells to each other they had a toxic house environment. She always yells to her husband also. But my wife is a calm person mostly, if you don't speak about her family or her mother she is okay.\nAfter 6 years, we decided to have a baby, my wife wants to have a baby since the beginning of our marriage, but I'm currently writing my PhD thesis and working as an academician, I always delayed by these reasons, but deep down I know that if we have a baby it means more time and more fight with her mother. When she will give birth she wanted me to get her mother with car to the city where we live, because of the corona virus, because her family is poor, none of them has a car. I told her I can rent a car and pay for it, so her brother can bring her, but her brother also hates her mother and he said I might get the virus while I was working it might be bad for you too, bla, bla, and finally I drive for 500 miles, 800kms and get her mother and bring her back to our house.\nThey said they will only accept me and my wife to the hospital because of the virus, and when her labor began her mother said I will be with her at the hospital you can wait outside and my wife accepted this, and when she is giving birth doctor told me I can come in to see the birth of my child but her mother yelled and insisted she will be there with her daughter. But I yelled at her and went to see my child during birth. Even the nurses told me your mother in law is a crazy and problematic person good luck with her.\nAfter our child born, she always come with stupid religious or superstitious stuff such as I have to burn my kids diaper if he had a shit on the diaper because if stray dogs eat his shit, it will be bad for our child's future. Or put a bread next to him because bread protects him or putting a yellow cloth on top of his head because she believes it will protect the baby from hepatitis or pull the baby's penis because he can have a better circumcision (which I\u2019m against). She is lunatic and I hate her. But my wife says, it's her beliefs, please let her do her thing, she will leave soon. And my wife says she also wants to go with her mom to her city 800kms away with our 30 days old baby because she always wanted to go to the city she born after she had the baby. (My wife is going there at least two or three times a year.) I told her that there are virus and her sister is working and going outside and might get the virus, and it's exhausting for a new baby to go that distance, but she cries and she says she needs this. And she wants me to drive her mother and her to there and stay with them for 2 weeks. This is also another problem.\nBut right now biggest crisis is, her mother always getting in our bedroom where we stay with the baby and never knocks the door always yells her sister when baby cries. She says I told you to dress the baby more (She dresses, baby three layers of dress and quilt and stuff on top of it baby is always sweating) and she yells eat this, don't eat that, you didn't do what I say because of you too, my baby cries and I'm turning into a crazy person, etc. Then I left the home and stayed at a friend\u2019s house for 6 hours she didn't call me at night but I turned back to home, stayed another room and she and her mother taking care of the baby and I don't know what to do.\nIf I knew this will be the result, as much as I love my wife and I was loyal to her since the beginning and I worked hard for our family, she only got temporary jobs with low wage and I always supported her, I supported her to get a second collage degree which she can find better jobs now and whatever. I always loved her, supported her, but her mother is always a problem for us and right now it's getting crazy. I think in the next days I will have to get her mother and her to where MIL is living and after that we will be back home together. I don't know it will be okay when we bake. But it's hurting for me that she will never stand up for me and she didn't see what her mother does to this relationship. She only remembers you yelled at my mom and stuff like this. I don't want to leave my wife and my child, but it's getting overwhelming to tolerate a person (my MIL) which normally I wouldn't even talk to.\nPs: My wife is mostly okey with my mom. She is a calm person. But my wife always says if you don't get along with my mom, I can't get along with your's also. Actually I don't care, I always tell her you can talk and say everything that bothers you to my mother and I also say anything if she gets annoyed. They don't have big problems, she also lives in another city which is a closer one 250km 150 miles and she always says if you don't come to my mother's village 1600kms, 800 miles I won't go to visit your mom and it bothered me for a while when we first married but for the last 2 years I tell her you can do whatever you want, you don't have to visit my mother or any relative but she also gets mad when I visit my family because I visit her's less and less and also she hates my brother and also his wife too because my brother makes jokes to my wife and reasons like that. And didn't tell him that she didn't like her jokes and forced me to tell to him many times and I argued with my brother many times because of this. I said my wife if you have a problem with my brother you can tell him anything and yell him if you want to. But she says nothing to them but always talking to me about him and says bad stuff about him. She only sees him once in two years for a day or so. And doesn't want me to visit my brother too who lives in another city. She doesn't exactly says don't visit him but she says she told me bad stuff and you love him more than me but he doesn't love you and stuff like that. As much as I love my wife, and she is a good person. Sometimes I think she has a personality disorder such as borderline, and she hates some people with the smallest thing and she worships her mother whatever she does.\n\n"}, {"title": "JNMom and JNSis begging DH for us to move in so they can help with their BABY  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "165", "comments": "44", "content": "This one is a bit long as it happened over the course of two days but DH and I have agreed we aren\u2019t giving in and are standing our ground. \nI will preface this by saying that I live in the Caribbean and we have certain cultural/religious customs when it comes to babies etc (the line is very blurred between what is culture, tradition and religion and both DH and I were raised in Catholic homes mine with a heavy Islamic influence).\nSo we have a dry season during which we experience water shortages in which we won\u2019t have water every day. Sometimes every other day sometimes not for three days this doesn\u2019t always follow a set schedule either. I live in an apartment so it\u2019s difficult to have stored water beyond our needs for a day or two at most. My mother lives in condo and has a large water storage tank. So I have come to depend on her sometimes for food etc because restaurants are closed and cooking is difficult w/o water. \nYesterday I called JNMom as we didn\u2019t have water and I had been out all day to see i would have been able to get dinner. While I was waiting for her to give me the food my sister (she\u2019s staying with my aunt re post where my bro kicked her out) calls DH on the phone. She goes into this long convo about how we (him and I are now acceptable) need to move in at my JNMoms house. They gist of it is that they need to take care of the baby and help. He basically just listened and gave her a very dismissive answer. \nToday we still had no water so my mom asked me if I wanted food and agreed to wash LOs clothes. There is apparently a special way in which this is done as per custom. I agreed because of how unpredictable our water supply is. So I go over and My aunt and JNSis come over because they too needed food and they had bought some baby clothes (before I hear about accepting things from my Sis we have very limited access to baby items the stores we do have access to are expensive and online shopping is not a thing because If we order from the US we have to pay exorbitant customs charges so at the moment in the time of corona where money is limited and supplies even more so I can\u2019t afford to turn the help away). So the conversation turned to the baby. I did not participate in it so much as it was happening around me. \nThey said that the baby should sleep on her belly. When I brought up SIDS I was told putting the baby on her back would cause her to choke on her own vomit and all of us had slept on our stomachs. \nHusband and I had agreed not to co-sleep but rather to have a bassinet besides the bed and to transition her to her own room at 6 months in a crib. They want me to buy a pack and play and have her sleep in that because a crib doesn\u2019t make sense. \nDH and I had agreed to try breastfeeding and use formula as a last resort. They are having a long as conversation about baby being formula fed and bottles (I\u2019m using glass but I used plastic as a baby so glass doesn\u2019t make sense). \nJNMom I should get rid of my cats cause baby might be allergic and even if baby isn\u2019t the cat will get jealous and shove it\u2019s tail up babies nose and try to kill it \nI wanted to cloth diaper (still my plan once she grows out of newborn size and customs duties on online purchases aren\u2019t as high) told that I have to use disposables. \nThat I need to wax shave and get a pedicure before I go into delivery else I will look like an old granny and my husband will find another woman. \nThat I need to change babies name and name her my mothers middle name which is similar to my name and sisters name. I hated growing up the fact that it took people 3 tries before they came up with the correct name and they constantly mispronounced it. \nThe topic of conversation then once more landed on us moving in with them. Our answer has consistently been no we won\u2019t be moving in you can see LO. JNMom and JNSis essentially want us to hand over LO so they can parent as they want. I was just repeating the same answer over and over so essentially they turned to DH to ask him to convince me. He keeps repeating the same thing as well that they will see LO bf we won\u2019t move in. They then make the point that DH and I aren\u2019t putting the needs of LO before our own as she would be in a more stable environment there. \nThis probably isn\u2019t going to end but we are standing firm on our NOs it\u2019s just the audacity of these people. They seem so caught up in t being deprived of THEIR baby that if I listened to their BS I\u2019d be depriving myself of the ability to parent.\n\n"}, {"title": "Winky the Elf in: \"Exactly how hard can I make literally everyone cringe?\"  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "35", "comments": "30", "content": "Long story short, my contact with Winky has been expanded from \"fuckall\" to include civilly refusing to respond to her bullshit in a family chat meant for orchestrating the kids' birthdays.

Dated for 5 years before getting married and both husband and sister in law would always tell me to not stay with their parents post marriage because we are very different from each other(I come from a wealthy business class fam, where we have 3-4 maids at home and all. MIL hated the concept of maids and my husband was very clear that I will not be subjected to those issues back home because we can very easily afford a help and therefore we won\u2019t stay with them among other reasons of us being very different. He himself before marriage used to barely come home due to an abusive alcoholic father and very persistent mother who was too set in her ways to allow another soul\u2019s changes, be it her own daughter. He would sail for 6 months and when he would come back to India, he would stay with me or with his friends but used to go home at max for 2/3 weeks. \nWe got hitched and had around 9 months before the wedding. As I said we never had plans to stay with our In laws because forget me, my husband had no interest whatsoever. But then my FIL passed away 10 days before the marriage. Dynamics changed. MIL was now alone. Emotions ran high and the decision was made that I will leave Delhi (staying independent and earning since 6 yrs) and come to stay with my MIL in her hometown now that she was alone. I agreed because I honestly had no choice left and if felt like the \u2018right thing\u2019 to do given the circumstances. Could not have become the bad DIL by refusing to stay with a 56 yr old widow and my own parents also insisted. \nTwo months later, got married. Everything went well. \nStarted living but clarified the condition that I will hire a help for house hold chores as I am working and my husband also clarified that now we can afford the help\u2019s salary easily and he does not want his mother (56) or his wife to do jhaadu pocha. (No, I am perfectly capable of doing it and know how to do it, just don\u2019t have the time with work and also because I alone earn enough to hire a help). \nShe reluctantly agreed. My husband does not let her spend a penny from her savings and ensured that the house goes in her name alone like a very good son. He made sure she feels safe and secure. My SIl also does not interfere and infact always supports us because she lives lavishly too. \nHowever, despite everything, my MIL has never been happy with me around. She is extremely controlling about her kitchen and house over all. The only place where I can do what I wish to do is my room and office. It went on like this for ages and honestly With not having time at hand I did not care about the kitchen till my food was being compromised. \nMy MIL would not let me hire a cook despite numerous requests and would insist on cooking for me(early office hours). I agreed, I mean why would I mind if the MiL wants to help. \nBut the problem is - I would get the same food or even stale food in office everyday. Complaint to my husband and he also told me that he had similar fights with her for the food quality. We politely spoke to her - Mom, if you cannot cook, we do not mind. Please let us hire a cook so that all of us remain happy. \nBut she refused. Things continued. \nI eventually had to enter the kitchen despite very less time at hand. Not habitual and very tired, I started fighting with my husband over these matters. Poor guy could not help because stubborn MIL would not let me cook also properly in the kitchen. She interferes even in how I strain my tea and which strainer I use. \nWhich wok I use and/or which Dal Or veggie I am making. She had a problem with my eating non veg and making it in the kitchen. \nIf I would keep something on the left, she would keep it on the right. \nOne day I complained to my SIL and she laughed saying, \u201cI TOLD YOU MY MOTHER IS A BHAWRA (bee that keeps roaming over your head) and she(MIl) makes my(SIL) life also hell when I do something different in her house\u201d. I was like how do I sort this problem. My SiL laughed and said, jhelo beta(you have to handle it) as you dont have a real choice now. It has been 1.5 years of our marriage. I speak on a social platform today. Why? \nBecause despite numerous requests, fights and issues, my MiL does not change. \nWe still have arguments on why we need a maid, or a cleaning maid. She only rinses utensils with water without using soap and I find that so unhygienic and fight with her over it. Maid cleans the utensils in the morning but MIl before she comes, early morning hides some of the utensils. She drinks water directly from a bottle and does not let us wash the bottle. I fight for basic cleanliness issues. The mental torture is crazy.

In the past she has taken photos and retouched them using Photoshop usually for good rather than evil. She shopped an aunt's shirt closed and brought a hem down before adding the aunt to a photo of everyone at a gathering. This time we were at BIL/GC\nand the light was poor so GG had asked me to take most of the pictures. Especially after FILs camera got stolen by GG. The rest of the visit GG was trying to 'shop me into group photos using her crappy unflattering photo of me, cropping it, and shoving it in back somewhere. One of BILs kids watched her trying my face on her own body and trying to make me look like her. GG swore she was \"having fun\" but the grandkids thought it was creepy. GG kept trying to get my //hair color// after I used dry shampoo and it frightened her because it looked so grey. I kept using the dry shampoo the whole visit to cover up my hair so she couldn't see it, and she wept that I had \"messed up\" her photos that I took.  She got drunk the night before the visit was over and boozily told me that she needed to \"SEE\" me, as in all of me, naked and that my refusal to give her my hair color was an affront to society and treason against her. I told her she'll never see me naked and my hair color is private, get some manners. Her hands went flying toward me in a flurry of impotent slapping motions as her chair sucked her drunk ass back into it. \nBefore we left, GG wanted a pic of all the adult kids together but she wouldn't let us wear any glasses or sunglasses. She wanted a picture she could make ID from! She had tried that before telling the police that one of her family went missing when they were at school or safely working out of state from her. \nThat's when I started wearing readers or sunglasses everywhere when we visit GG, \"so I can smile and not squint.\" I also keep my hair greyer with a rinse and dry shampoo so she won't know how blonde I might be.

We are also expecting our first LO any day now. \nThis past April a week before Easter she sent a text to me, DH and SIL asking when we could all come over for dinner once she was out of state mandated quarantine for traveling.  I will not lie my first thought was \"You and FIL are both over 60 and he has not been 100% since he retired so ... NO\" Luckily I was saved from responding by my wonderful SIL reminding MIL that with number of people, the ILs health concerns, and my impending LO that a gathering of 10+ people was not smart. \nSo yesterday, I (just me not my DH) gets an email about what kind of diapers we need for the LO since they are at the store. I tell her the brand and thank her for thinking of DH and I as we have continued to social distance as much as we can to protect me and LO. This was apparently not enough of a response because this morning I get a text saying she is looking at my registry and sees that there is still a lot of items that we \"need\" ( I say need because now it is just funny onesies and a couple toys nothing to prevent good care of LO). Well since she is asking I say some diaper rash cream would be appreciated since you can never have enough.  She responds with a wall of text saying she is happy to help and that she can't wait to see us again but \"she will continue to respect our choice to social distance\".  \nAfter that text I recognize what she is trying to get me to do.

Refuses to Apologize. Now what?  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "943", "comments": "190", "content": "My MIL is probably the worst human being. In short, she can be described as the epitome of white trash. She possesses the inability to show empathy or remorse, lacks all financial responsibility or maturity, and has a talent for manipulating others, lying and using people to get what she wants. She has an extensive history of drug use, a criminal background of embezzlement and vehicular manslaughter, and she just overrall sucks. She's one of those people who fakes an injury to collect disability, regardless of how able-bodied she actually is!  Apparently she has been trying to keep clean and go to church these days... but only the Lord knows. \nMy FIL is amazing. He is one of the sweetest, most selfless, most forgiving people I know. MIL divorced him several years ago, but quickly came crawling back after her settlement money was wasted on her party lifestyle. Unfortunately my FIL is entertaining the idea of a relationship with her, so she is always around if I want to visit him. \nOver a year ago, I attended a family function with my husband. Everyone had been drinking, and my husband and I got in a drunken argument. MIL must have overheard, because she crawled out of the basement, like the troll she is, and punched me in the face. I did not punch her back. I just remember yelling some 4-letter words and having another family member drive me home because I was having a panic attack and crying. \nMy husband didn't know she hit me at the time. In fact, she straight up denied it and told him she was sober. Lies. I debated pressing charges, but chose not to. Probably a mistake. When I told my husband the truth the next day, he was angry with his mother and urged her to apologize. She didn't. We live out of state, so I am very lucky to never have to see that waste-of-space MIL except for a couple days a year. After an obviously unapologetic MIL showed her true colors, I sent my MIL a message letting her know I didn't wish to see or communicate with her again. My husband urged her for over a year to apologize to me, and she continuously refused, saying she was \"scared\" and that I \"intimidate her\", or \"I don't know what to say\". However, she still managed to include me in stupid group messages and other impersonal messages, never once including an apology.\nWell tonight was the first night I saw my MIL since she physically assaulted me over a year ago. I hated it. I just wanted to stay neutral and not interact with her, but its hard.. She kept trying to start fake small talk with me, and her pretending everything was fine insulted me even more. She's not used to facing the  consequences of her poor choices, her family let's A LOT slide. She thinks she can just sweep things under the rug.\nI love my husband. However, this situation is one that always causes an argument. He doesn't think it was right that his mother hit me, but he also doesn't think it's THAT big of a deal. He says I'm \"not the first person to ever get punched\" and I need to \"let it go\". He apparently grew up in this Jerry Springer world and isn't a stranger to seeing people get in fights or throw a punch. I grew up in an upper middle class, educated family who didn't resort to violence to solve problems. (No, he isn't a violent person and does not hit me) \nSo I understand that my husband wants me at family functions without it being weird with his mom. I would like to be at those functions too. I love my husband's family, minus my MIL, the queen of the trailer park. He didn't choose the useless uterus hotel he came out of, but she IS his mom. He always says \"yeah she sucks, but she's my mom\". \nI guess I'm trying to figure out where to go from here. Am I disrespecting myself by being in the same house as that sociopathic twat after I told her I didn't want to see her again? Do I need to pull her aside at the next family get together and tell her about herself and just call her out? I want to find compromise, but I don't want to be the only one doing the compromising.

We were approaching his 40th birthday, and I asked him if he wanted a party/ dinner some sort of celebration to mark the occasion. He chose to have a family party, at our house, so all of his folks, and all of mine were invited. \nWe had a lovely buffet meal for everyone, lovely casseroles with sides all prepared by myself and my chef sister in law, and booze provided by our siblings. As was usual, the differing age groups split up. Older and younger ones in one room, the party animals in the open plan kitchen diner where the bar and buffet were. The plan was chat and mingle, food, clear up, toast by me, and response by hubby and then more chat and home time.\nWe served up the the food, and as we were clearing up, I told hubby to round everyone up into the sitting room, make sure they all had a drink and that the kitchen brigade would be in in a moment to give a toast. My mum, my sister, sister in law, niece and myself were all sorting out the dishwasher etc  and were just getting ready to go in and do the toast - we were less than 5 minutes behind hubby at that moment., when my slightly tiddly brother in law came in to refill his glass and innocently told us that we had missed the speeches and toast!!! \nOur faces must have been a picture as even in his befuddled state he said \u201cwhat???\u201d I stormed into the sitting room where MIL was standing with her arm round DH giving a speech (apparently her second) about how wonderful he was..... I grabbed hubby and dragged him out and asked him what he thought he was doing - and it appears that as he was checking that people had drinks she grabbed him and launched into the speech she had been planning. I told him that what she had done was out of order - it was my house, I was the hostess, and she hadn\u2019t even checked that hubby\u2019s own wife and daughter, never mind every other woman present were in the room before she gave the speeches.\nI told him to carry on getting the champagne/ Buck\u2019s Fizz/ orange juice together (did I say that half of the folk in the sitting room didn\u2019t have drinks?) whilst I got everyone into the bigger room. We ensured that all had a drink, and I launched in to my hostess speech, thanking them all for coming, saying what a wonderful hubby and father DH was etc and asked EVERYONE  present to join me in wishing him a happy birthday and and many more successful years ahead. The whole party -apart from MIL - did so, and then hubby responded, thanking me  and SIL for catering, our siblings for the booze and hoping that we had many more occasions to come. \nOnce everyone had settled back into their chat groups, she came over and had the nerve to tell me that I was rude. Well, dear reader, several Bellinis and glasses of champagne later, I had had enough, and let her have it.... she was told in no uncertain terms that SHE had been incredibly rude trying to assume the hostess/ wife role. I told her that she hadn\u2019t been asked to make a speech by either myself, or hubby, and she had a cheek to do it without ensuring that all OUR  guests were present. She was told that in my house it was my rules, and she had wildly overstepped the mark with her behaviour, and I invited her to leave.\nOnce she left, the party swung into gear, we ate drank and made merry until the wee small hours. We woke the next morning to a fabulous brunch prepared by SIL, and hubby\u2019s phone and email were blowing up with the howls of indignation from MIL. We discussed what had happened with BIL and SIL who had witnessed me telling her off, so hubby knew exactly what had been said. \nWe let her stew until all our resident guests had left, and the hangovers had abated, then called her back. We had her on speakerphone so I heard what she was trying to say.Hubby bless him, actually stopped her before she got into her stride and told her that no, I hadn\u2019t been rude to her, or insulted her. He said that SHE owed us both an apology for trying to take over our evening, for insulting all the other women by not ensuring they were there for the unasked for interference. He pointed out how hard SIL and I had worked to provide the food, and he had noted that unlike my mother, she had not lifted a finger or opened her purse to help with the party in any way and that her behaviour was incredibly insulting to both me, and him as he was embarrassed on my behalf.\nShe put the phone down on him, and then tried to whine to BIL and SIL as they drove home and apparently they said pretty much the same thing. Needless to say we never got the apology, and she sulked for about a month before she broke and called him. That was the beginning of the end of our relationship, although it limped along as an uneasy truce for another 15 years..... \nNext instalment - hubby\u2019s 50th party!\n\n"}, {"title": "Taking the Leap  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "23", "comments": "6", "content": "Obligatory don't use my post or the comments within outside of this sub.

This is an important tidbit. \nSo, for a few years before the incident, we as a family started doing holidays at  home (at the time mostly to save $$$), but it became the status quo and has remained that for about a decade now. \nThis brings us to my DD request, she wants to \u201cmeet\u201d her father\u2019s family. Mind you, she has met them many times, but was still too young to remember. This is not my problem. \nMy problem is that, my MIL (and SO) see nothing wrong with changing things up and essentially taking away \u201cmy\u201d holidays with \u201cmy\u201d family. And again, I know, this is a SO problem before a MIL problem. And, as I said, if she wasn\u2019t pushing (and if my DD wasn\u2019t asking), it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Or maybe I\u2019m blind.\nI\u2019m not asking for advice, as I\u2019ve already made the decision to say fuck it and give up our family\u2019s \u201ctraditions\u201d so they can go. No I won\u2019t be attending. \nThis is mostly just a rant, because I\u2019m mad at my bitch MIL because this all started with her asking and my DD being a child and wanting these familiar bonds and being prone to manipulation. I am also mad at my dumbass husband for thinking all of this is ok. \nOh but the title, he constantly brings up how he wishes I\u2019d just forgive my MIL and move on. Which will never happen if she cannot apologize. Which she never will. \nAnyways, I needed to vent, and I apologize and thank everyone at the same time. \n/tears hair out.\n\n"}, {"title": "The time my mother prophesied I would become an unwed mother...

Not sure what to flair- this happened 4ish years ago, but has reared it\u2019s ugly head lately, so I thought I might share. I\u2019m open to suggested responses (skip to last 2 paragraphs for this), but the majority of this story is older. \nGrew up a pastors daughter, and boy...the pressure was real. We were NOT Pentecostal, but you wouldn\u2019t have known it by the standards my mother had for me. I could only wear skirts or dresses -no pants allowed on church property, no running, playing, talking unless spoken to, etc (for context-I grew up in this church community, it had wonderful people and nobody was pressured to live by these rules. My mother feels that as a pastors family we were called to \u201chigher standards\u201d and was desperate to maintain the \u201cperfect family\u201d reputation at all costs). \nIn high school, I was not really that interested in dating. My school was small and I had known most people from diaper-age. In college a good friend of mine and I started dating and my parents were NOT happy (secretly met with him and told him I was not mature enough or capable of having a healthy relationship based off of my life decisions...I hadn\u2019t spent more than an hour with them once a month in over 3 years). Tons of stories about this terrible season of life, but today is about my moms dreams. \nMy then Bf and I were out on a simple Friday night date: walked the park and then drove through Dairy Queen for ice cream. My mom calls as we\u2019re pulling up to DQ and demands to know where I was. In my shock and naivety I let her know that then-bf and I were getting ice cream, and she demands we stay there, she was on her way. \nShe arrives, yells at me to get in her car and tells me that we\u2019re leaving, I can call then bf later. Please take into consideration that I\u2019m am almost 21 at this point, and had been living on my own since I was 18. I was sure somebody had died or there had been an accident with how she was acting. She drives up the road and parks in a parking lot and tells me that she has something important to say: the Lord gave her a dream. \nI know, I know...don\u2019t strain your eyes rolling them too hard. I was pissed and wanted to leave, but the twisted side of me wanted to hear what in the world she had come up with. She lets me know that the lord gave her a dream warning her that if I didn\u2019t end the relationship I was in, I was going to be an unwed mother, and then-bf would refuse to be in the picture. Several other pastors daughters had gotten pregnant unmarried and that I must be following the same path as them since I wasn\u2019t going to church anymore. \nSpoiler alert: we didn\u2019t break up for 3 more years (and on our terms). I was never pregnant with his child. BUT, when now-fianc\u00e9 and I told my parents that we found out we were pregnant last fall and then miscarried...she was SMUG when she made sure to mention that she was \u201cright\u201d about her dream of me being an unwed mother being from the lord. \nAbout a week ago I was on the phone with my youngest sibling (20, also moved out at 18) the other day when he mentions he\u2019s got a quaran-tine (like valentine: a girl staying with him during the quarantine). We talk about it for just a moment and he says that our mom is freaking out. That she called him the other day and I\u2019ll give you a wild guess what she said...\nShe had a dream that instead of moving home on the fall to continue his work-education, he moved home with his lady-friend because she was pregnant and he had to skip the continuing work-education and it ruined his life. That the lord gave her this dream to warn him that he needed to move her out and turn his life around. \nYALL I had to take a minute. I let him know that it\u2019s happened to me too, and that our other sibling has most likely had the same experience. It turned out to be a bittersweet sibling bonding moment where I told him about my miscarriage for the first time, and let him know that our mom has no higher authority or power or wisdom that he is an adult capable of making decisions on his own, but that as adults we also have to live with the consequences (so wrap it up lol). \nI\u2019ve been speaking with a therapist and she has been helping me work on standing up for myself and communicating with my mom in a healthy manner. I have my mom a call the other day and we had one of the healthiest conversations we\u2019ve had in a long time! I was feeling happy and hopeful and looking forward to more opportunities for success (vvvlc right now). Yesterday I was cleaning out my closet and found a shirt she and I both loved, but hasn\u2019t fit in several years. I texted her a funny pic about how I was finally letting it go...and she just couldn\u2019t help herself:\n\u201cPut it (the shirt) in the back of your closet and think about it. If no regrets, then you can give it away. Also, I had another dream about you last night. You can let me know when you want to hear it when we\u2019re together next.\u201d\nSo not only am I, a 25 year old adult who owns my own home, works at a law firm, and has various other responsibilities, not allowed to get rid of my own clothes from high school without her permission (ha! Already in the donation box)...she\u2019s also had another Dream. I\u2019m tempted to reply, \u201cno thanks\u201d and be done with it, but am nervous about such a stark response. Any suggestions on how to navigate this obvious \u201cbait\u201d tactic? Her dreams are always something awful that she predicts will be our futures...but so far have only concerned things she considers to be issues.

He\u2019s an introvert so he freaking loves it....me, not so much. I thought I was an introvert but nope, turns out I need people sometimes so I think I\u2019m more of an ambivert. I\u2019m definitely struggling spending all day every day inside and feeling left out at work (i am the only one at home) and blah blah blah. I have spoken to my doctor and have been speaking to a psych as well to try and manage my emotions. T-Rex knows none of this though, she gets zero insight into my life.\nThe other week was SO birthday. We spent it in iso together drinking, eating cheese and watching terrible action movies. T-Rex arranged to call him on his bday as she is 3000kms away. He was okay with this. I was wandering in and out of the room during the call and it all seemed to go really well. It was quite long (unusual) but all sounded positive and he felt good after. Cut to today. JYaunt messages me to warn me T-Rex is on an anti-me tirade and is apparently ringing all the family leaving long rambling messages about me being a terrible person. I\u2019m perplexed. What did I do? \nSo, during the phone call between T-Rex and SO she gave him some garbled story about how his cousin and cousins wife have split up. As per usual, it was hard to get actual details out of her. He asked me about it after as I am friends with cousin on social media (SO does not use social media) and I was like....uhhhh they are still showing as married and there\u2019s photos of them together? We were confused. I asked JYaunt about it and she clarified the rumour for us. \nApparently that clarification convo got back to T-Rex who (from what we can gather) then went off the deep end that I had asked JYaunt about it. From what we can work out she\u2019s mad for two reasons - firstly that he told me and secondly that I asked JYaunt. I think she\u2019s totally out of line as 1. We have been together like...7 years now, of course he told me and 2. I am the main point of contact with his family - he has no social media and is terrible with casual conversations. I talk to JYaunt 2-3 time\u2019s a week so this isn\u2019t exactly out of character and she knows we speak often. I am doubting myself a little though but I think it\u2019s just because I\u2019m in a funk so her being a bitch is getting to me a lot more than usual.\nI warned SO about it as he will probably have contact in the next week due to Mother\u2019s Day and he told me she\u2019s being ridiculous and if she tries to complain to him he will tell her so and revert back from low contact to very very low contact. \nSuch a minor incident and nothing like some of our past altercations, never mind all the other terrible things happening in the world but it has successfully gotten me down.\n\n"}, {"title": "There will be fall out - 27 year old DD ask her grandma if they can sing Happy Birthday to me too.  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "231", "comments": "24", "content": "The big take away here is I don't have to go to the stupid BBQ.  Yes the govt here is loosening restrictions on Monday because everyone has been really good and our province doesn't get major international direct flights so cases are low low low. But that doesn't mean the risk is gone and one SIL works in a seniors care home so - hard pass on that anyway.\nI started typing this long rant after I found this website search \"what does dil OWE HER iN-LAWS\"\nhttps://www.focusonthefamily.ca/content/7-things-to-remember-when-your-in-laws-can-t-let-go \nAnyway, MIL always holds a family dinner for her three kids and wants to have a  deckside BBQ for SIL the one with the nice boyfriend. But MIL wants to hold it NEXT weekend on Mother's Day.  makes sens with restrictions still on this weekend. after wards we can gather up to 10 people.  not because it's safe it's so they can TRACK it. Fak.\nSo, my darling step-DIL asked her grandma if they could also sing happy b-day to me during SIL B-day party.  because my birthday is also coming up this week.  I am generally given a lovely gift of cash during the party for SIL.  MIL always remembers me but this is done out of sight of the others.  AS in MIL, \"OP come in here for a moment\".  Then in the kitchen, with fake big smile \"happy birthday\"  hands me cheque.  Me, \"Oh thank you very much. You're very generous\".  Oh I forgot the kiss on the lips every single family member gets when you arrive.... ack)\nBasically, I am not allowed to be acknowledge because other SIL doesn't like SHARING her Birthday,  That's ok, years ago one of my best friends was like that.  (She turned out to be a narc... it's a bit sad.)\nSo, my MIL doesn't even remember I suppose or maybe she does.  but she can't say out loud WHY SIL and I are not celebrated together.  We did it the first year after DH and I were together 4 months - big show of havin 2 birthdays.  It up set SIL a lot. (Did you see wjat she did there? Narc points for MIL) So that was scrapped 22 years ago.   So she tells my daughter essentailly that \"She's not really  a member of this family anyway... DD says how can you say that? MIL well what has she ever done for this Family... (she NEEDS me to host Thanks giving so that we will be forced to spend time with shitty DIL who disrespects me so badly when she's here I have decided she never gets in my apt again.  SOOOO last summer I rented a cabin for the weekend and had father's day there after MIL was twisting in the wind all last year trying to make me host something.\nRight, right, the first reason given to not sing Happy b-day to me was that MIL only hosts parties for HER OWN family.  True other SIL's hubby doesn't get a party.  So DD says I'm not asking for a whole party just an brief acknowledgment.  The \"I only host my own kids was the official party line when it stopped after year one.  She ca't say SIL doesn't want to share because their offense to everything is \"You are rude. Ohhh that's what DD said That's rude Grandma - at some point the ultimate insult in that family because that's what I,OP am when i want to go see my family at Christmas \"rude\" boundaries are rude  when OP is doing them.  phone call ended badly - I think grandma hung up on each other.  I don't know because DD called her dad who she loves very much and told about the call .\nMIL ultimately says she's not really a member of this family anyway and whay has she done for this family?    So - yay!  I have the trump card to get out of everything now. Phew. And I fucking going to church this Christmas eve to sing German Christmas Carols with the people I grew up with. Try to fucking stop me.  Also, i have happily blocked her ... finally had a reason.  Every post of the roses i grow in doors , \"beautiful\" gah.  I'm also friends with a couple of cousins so that fake veneer must be shown. No more no more.\nHere's the laundry list, because apparently I've never done anything for this family according to a statement made by MIL last night.\n-I supported DH for the first 18 years of now 23 years of living together. My wonderful step daughter now 27 always lived with her mom but we picked he up after school everday and had lots of other activities in the everning and weekends. Her mom doesn't do activities, like swimming.\n\"Loaned\" the 2 evil SILs money steadily for stuff. DIL can I borrow money for my meds, ($40) she turns up with barbie posters for her nieces and plastic statuettes she collects.  I told her, she should make a budget, response \"what's that\"?\n-Helped raise wonderful DIL (27) music lessons, sports groups, art classes for which i included her close cousin.  2 larger ticket mommy-daughter trips in recent years.\nDH and I are \"living together\" I never wanted him to file for divorce because things were sufficiently peaceful in the land with ex. (once we got control of a proper protocol to pick up DD when she was little.)\nI dutifully attended Christmas at the exact time MIL prescribed which was promoptly moved to when my family celebrates causing friction EVERY CHRISTMAS to try an see my senior parents (in the same city) now deceased for 4 and 7 years. She knows when the church service is 7pm.  But no I haven't even attend for 4 years due to the stress from friction and Christmas being ruined now for many years. I'm just another fucking robot attending her party.\nEntertained my SIL every Saturday for 2 entire summer seasons when she showed up unannounced and too often. (At our destination area home an apartment in a town bordered by an amazing park / lakes.\nI guess my crimes are not making enough money because  for a solid job we moved 1.5 hours from the  city to this beautiful area. Over that time between his 2 sisters one found and moved in with a really good guy, thank goodness.  Because she always needed DH to be her plus one and PAY for everything... come to think of it so did other SIL.  So we stopped supporting them in every way. So now the In-laws are supporting other SIL.  This is a sin that we no longer take care of them because DH, who is the oldest, was PROGRAMMED to \"TAKE CARE OF YOUR SISTERS\".  this never been said out loud I have just figured it our over the year searching through the fog for my beloved.\nAfter 23 years I am free from those 3 crazy bitches.\nThe middle sister SIL is slowly coming around because her man is gently getting her out of the fog.   She now pointed out to my DH that their parent s are giving other SIL \"so much money\" at least $1000/mo because ya know a single woman with no depends and a job and a small mortage burns through that kind of money. The gambling/alcohol shouldn't bother the parents she needs money that's all they know. (Hmm maybe they don't know. Might be time for so meddling - oh I'm so petty I could just say, \"Now that DH doesn't give her money anymore for her gambling I guess you have to.....\"Oh that would be the END of it but I don't care I'm trying to lead by example.   That wasn't a problem when it was coming out of my wallet but now it's coming out of \"her\" pile, SIL. The inheritance.  In-laws just turned 80 they live for 20 more years.  They outright told DH and I they have no intention of leaving any money for their kids.  i should pass that on tho other SIL ... no I will not, not not participate in the BS lord help me.\nI told DH - do NOT confront your mother about what your daughter shared with you. We're not playing that game. We know what happened, we know what was said.  By know MIL probably doesn't even remember it that way with her golden child grand daughter.  I feel bad for me step daughter. coming out of the fog hurts.  She's always know her grandma wasn't nice to me but this could be a serious break for the norm what was said and one last night.\nNone of this hurts me - my only concerns are the happiness of the people i care about and getting DH out of the FOG as gently as possible as he's prone to depression. He was definitely out last night.\nFun fact DH only calls me names when we're on the way to his mom's house.  I have taken to saying I'm pretty sure you're angry with someone else and this is someone else you are calling a bitch.  He generally responds with \"there you go.\" Here's the trick by DH he doesn't even realize he's pulling: cause so much tension worrying about what transpire at the family dinner, and worrying at what point your sister calls me a bitch.  DH was literally trying to teach me to grey rock \"just don't say anything \" which i though was so strange. What is the point of attending if I am not really wanted ther??? So anyway his fights cause so much aggravation that I am so tense that I can't just be me or grey rock properly when we arrive.  So clearly any tension at the family dinner is because I was acting strange. Yah, you just yelled at me in the car for 1.5 hours to \"NOT CAUSE PROBLEMS\". Because DH you are so programmed to feel that nothing is ever your mother's or your sister's faults... therefor computing, computing, it must be OP's fault.  No one else around to blame.\nYes I almost left him BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY.  Glad I stuck through it though. Things are good really and we only argue on the way to family events and those are off my list now - yay.   I shall try to organize a brief drive by visit with SIL close to or on her B-day and then I'm golden.\n\n"}, {"title": "Preventative measures  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "78", "comments": "29", "content": "So, I usually post on here after something crazy has already happened, and I usually receive wonderful advice that can't even be used since the moment has passed. \nThis time, I want to get advice before shit hits the fan. Ya'll have been so freaking wonderful.\nSo anyone who is following my story knows our wedding plans changed because of COVID. I live in state X, fianc\u00e9 lives in state Y, his family lives in state Z. Originally we were going to have a LARGE wedding in state X--> now we are doing a small wedding in state Y at the end of the summer. \nWith the plan change we agreed it would be good for his family to visit him in State Y the week before the wedding day. Originally, I was not going to arrive until 4 days before the wedding to move all my stuff in and get situated. I also was going to be staying with my family at a hotel while his family stays at our apartment. (We're waiting till marriage and this set-up is pretty traditional, so I didn't have a problem).\nHowever, my dear dear father after hearing this plan came to me and said \"Hon, I think that if FMIL even has a few days at the apartment without you there, it will be impossible to reclaim the apartment, kitchen, etc. is yours. I think you need to go out to state Y long before his family does, move in your stuff, and get situated with fianc\u00e9. This will flip the situation so it is clear this is YOU and FIANCES home that his family are GUESTS in.\" \nHe also advised that I bring an air mattress and stay in the apartment while his family is there too in order to further establish that it is our home and they are guests. \nMy dad is crazy smart and I could not believe I hadn't considered this. So now our plan has changed so I will be fully moved in before his family even arrives. \nIn the interest of preventive measures, these are a few things I can see happening:\n\nWhen they hear that I am going out ahead of time MIL will throw a fit and possibly try to come out earlier. She'll say \"we need some time ALONE with MY son.\" \nAt the apartment MIL thinks the kitchen is hers. She cooks what she wants every night and wont let me cook in my own kitchen. (I am good at cooking and enjoy it)\nIf I am able to cook in my own kitchen, MIL will complain about the food. She is picky about oil and sensitive to salt. I can see her complaining about things \"being too salty\" even if I don't add a pinch.\nMIL may try to arrange the house furniture as she sees fit, or complain about the \"crammed\" guest room\nMIL will attempt to get us to change our wedding night plans because she is \"uncomfortable\"\nMIL will complain about my family \"not making an effort\"\nMIL will complain about my revealing outfits (summer in a humid-ass state- of course ill be wearing tank tops, shorts , dresses, etc.)\nMIL will make nasty comments on the wedding day or attempt to shift focus on her by crying or faking injury (deadass in the past I have watched her \"fake trip\" so my fianc\u00e9 has to catch her. She also frequently complains about back aches and expects massages from my fianc\u00e9- no clue if this is a cultural thing or her being weird as hell)\nFIL (not MIL) will make a speech at the wedding about the importance of \"not leaving family\". They have this idea that marriage means me becoming part of THEIR family and not fianc\u00e9 and I starting our OWN family. \n\nGranted, I don't know if any of this will actually happen- I also do not feel anxiety over it, nor am I dreading the experience. I feel very happy for my wedding day and am determined not to let anything ruin it. I just know I tend to get emotional in the moment and having some constructive advice ahead of time would be lovely. \n(also some more advice about the weird back massage thing would be helpful- I really hate it, but also it might be a cultural difference. Then again she's obsessive over fianc\u00e9 so it might not be an innocent cultural difference after all. I really don't know)\n\n"}, {"title": "BF and I considering marriage, how do I talk to him about his controlling mom?  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "22", "comments": "35", "content": "This is going to be a long post.\nMy BF and I have been together for 6 years. I am 25 and he is 33. Now that I am close to graduating from school we are starting to think about getting married. However, I have an issue with his mom and how controlling she is. In general she is a sweet person and has never given me personally any trouble, but she treats my bf like a houseboy and orders him around and is generally very controlling. They are of a culture where parents are more \u201ccontrolling\u201d (I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have a better word for this, I don\u2019t mean to disrespect any cultures). I am the entire opposite and my mom raised me to be independent and always allowed me to explore and flourish, so this is a clash. Another important piece of information is we live an hour away from each other and only get to see each other on the weekends. We alternate going to each other\u2019s houses for the entire weekend. Some examples of things she does (keep in mind this man is 33 years old): \n-Opens his mail even after he\u2019s asked her not to. One time opened a letter with some medical results in it and when he confronted her she cried and said she \u201chas a right to know\u201d. He ended up apologizing to her.\n-Orders him around and expects him to drop whatever he's doing at the moment to do what she wants. This has happened so many times while I\u2019ve been over and we\u2019re spending time together. We have been on our way out the door to go somewhere when she tells him he needs him to fix something, put something together, etc. He\u2019ll tell her it\u2019s not urgent and doesn't need to be done right away and she\u2019ll throw a fit so he\u2019ll go and do it. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t give in but most of the time he does it. She\u2019s also \u201cmade\u201d him do this very late at night when he has work early the next morning. He also calls it \u201chelping\u201d her but its not helping, its doing. She\u2019ll come home from shopping with an item that needs very simple set up and will bark at him to go put it together. He also works on cars so his mom and sister both demand he work on their cars when it needs tune ups. Sometimes he's mentioned he's very busy and cant do an oil change right away and that they can pay $30 this one time to get it done and they flip out. He basically does EVERYTHING for his mom, if I listed out all the tasks he does for her it would be too long. \n-Similarly, she makes him go places with her at her whim. She\u2019ll come in his room and wake him up and tell him they need to go to xyz place and to get ready now. She does this when I\u2019m over too.\n-He drives her most places. She works in a city an hour away and carpools and will sometimes miss her carpool and will wake him up at 5 am to drive an hour to drop her off, drive back home for an hour, THEN he has to get ready for work and commute to work. She also has a bank in a city an hour and a half away and he has to drive her there. She has a car and knows how to drive but is \u201cscared\u201d and doesn't like to. \n-Cries if he's over at my house/out with me too much and says she\u2019s lonely and be needs to be home, but when he\u2019s home she stays in her room, watches tv, or talks on the phone with her friends. No family interaction\n-Goes through/reorganizes his room. He\u2019s told me this is a cultural thing and I can accept that but I\u2019m still including it to show the full picture. \n-His sister also bosses him around. He runs around doing things for his sister and has even written a statement for an internship for her after harassment from both his mom and sister over it. \n-Springs things on him last minute. I\u2019ll be over and she\u2019ll come in his room telling him they have an appointment, etc in an hour and he needs to get ready. She doesn\u2019t tell him things like this in advance. \n-She tries to tell him which jobs to apply to, which cars to buy, etc. Thankfully he doesn\u2019t listen to her but she still does this all the time. \n-Calls him multiple times a day, if he\u2019s at my house or at theirs (she\u2019ll call when we\u2019re out). I don\u2019t know what she calls about because she speaks her native language, but she pretty much always calls at least once a day when I\u2019m with him. \n-In the beginning of our relationship, she would call him and tell him to come home when he was over at my house. She would also open his door at night multiple times and check us when we were sleeping. She stopped doing both of these things thankfully. \n-She also bosses around and controls his sister, but not to the extend she does to him (I have a few stories of her being extremely controlling to his sister).\nThere are other things of this nature but I honestly can\u2019t even remember all of them because there\u2019s so much. \nAlso a note that she is perfectly physically and mentally able to do these tasks. \nIn addition to all of this, she uses the death of his father who passed 11 years ago to guilt him into not moving out. He has tried on multiple occasions and when he brings it up she flips out, cries, and tells him he needs to do the things his dad used to do around the house. He even sometimes fees guilty coming over to my house for the whole weekend because his mom is home alone (never mind that she sees her friends every weekend, goes to parties with them, has a dance group, goes to church events, etc, and that he\u2019s with her all during the week). He \u201chas\u201d to buy her red roses like his dad would get her every valentines day. Sometimes I feel like she treats him like her husband instead of her son. \nI am also not open to parents living with us unless they are unable to take care of themselves and I know she will try to live with us. We plan to move to a different city next year but I honestly do not see how he\u2019ll be able to leave her with the guilt tripping. \nI know he just wants to be a good son and feels like he\u2019s abandoning her if he stands up to her, but there needs to be a balance. I understand there is a cultural component and thats not something I can change or try to change. However, I refuse to marry someone who lets their mother run their life, and as a result allow her to run MY life. I know she will try to dictate our wedding, what house we buy, where we live, how to raise our kids, etc and she will continue to demand his time. \nA another big problem is she wants to move to where the rest of her family is after she retires. I don\u2019t care for this city and don\u2019t want to move there any time soon (I\u2019d be open to it if we got married and moved there when we are older to get be closer to his family) and don't want to move there solely because my bf\u2019s mother tells him to. Also the thought of a man moving cities just to follow his mom around is extremely unattractive to me. When I\u2019ve brought it up he says he's staying with me and she won\u2019t try to get him to move but I think he's in denial (she lost her shit over his sister not spending one NYE with them, why wouldn\u2019t she flip over him saying he doesn\u2019t want to move with her?). I know she will guilt him like she always does and will throw a massive fit. She\u2019s mentioned different jobs to him down there multiple times (areas he\u2019s not even interested in) and has even mentioned that theres good nursing jobs for me in this city. \nI have no idea how to bring this up. I tend to be a very direct person and he is more sensitive, and I don\u2019t know how to bring it up in a more gentle way. I know no matter how I bring it up he will be upset and get defensive, but I still want to do it in a loving and non-accusitory way. I have left the topic alone before as we hadn't talked about marriage and I felt it wasn't my place to discuss his mother like this. I know that I cannot change him and I am not trying to, I just want to tell him he either stands up to his mom and addresses this or the relationship is over. I know she will be causing problems and running his life (and trying to run mine) for the rest of my life if we get married. Just the thought of having children with this woman present like this stresses me out. It\u2019s unfortunate because I love him so much and he\u2019s great in so many ways but I know if I sign up for a lifetime of this I will be miserable and will probably grow to resent him.

They're mostly about me/my past that I remember.\nYesterday was Beltane. My mom (MM) and my uncle (MU) celebrate Beltane. My Future Hubby (FH) and I are living with them, so we celebrated with them. FH and I really just saw it as an excuse to drink and burn parts of a tree branch that fell in the backyard last time it stormed.\nBeltane, from my understanding, is basically celebrating the season of spring. It's supposed to be a holiday of love (in general, not romantic), fire, dreams, and passions. Last night was mostly a reflection of how we've had love in our lives that weren't romantic. Now, I will say that MM went to bed around midnight. It was mostly MU, FH and I towards the end of the night.\nI know that I was drunk far quicker then anyone else. I had pounded vodka shots after a hard, frustrating week. But I also remember drinking crap tons of water towards the end and kind of received some clarity about how badly I got fucked in the mom department.\nI ended up venting a lot to MU and FH. So I'm going to write down what I remember venting about.\n\u200b\n\nMy earliest memories were of my dad beating the fuck out of me, and my mom either cheering him on or just watching.\nI remember being in elementary school (4-10 yrs old) and throughout that time hearing how other kids were treated by their moms.\n\n\nI honestly thought moms never actually took care of their kids. That it was solely just something left over from the era of all ladies are housewives.\nMy mom never tucked me in, never made me any of my meals even on her days off, she never comforted me when I was upset or had nightmares.\nThe only time she took care of me was when I was sick and that was because she works in the medical field and treated me like a patient.\nShe always seemed so annoyed when it came to my birthdays. I genuinely didn't have any excitement for my birthdays anymore after a certain age.\nAnd I remember her recording a convo between her and me which she used to gain full custody of me. But then immediately dropped me off to school to process, at 9, that my parents are getting a divorce and I broke down.\n\nThere's a lot of things I don't remember about my childhood which I learned might be linked to depression and anxiety problems. Some deep rooted mental illnesses that I might have gotten from my mom.\nIn high school (around 15 yrs old), after my siblings are all born, I got put into the position of being their mom essentially because my mom worked nights at a hospital and my step dad refused to take care of my siblings (his bio kids)\n\n\nI kept telling MM that I have anxiety and depression issues. That I needed help. Took a suicide attempt for her to take it seriously.\nI was so stressed out from being basically the mom of the house and reaching the goal of actually graduating high school, that I threatened to call CPS on MM and step dad.\n\n\nMM literally threw a phone book at me and said something along the lines of \"If you think your life is so fucking bad, then you go ahead and call them. But if you siblings get taken away from this home, then that is YOUR fault. What happens to them after CPS takes all of you, is YOUR FAULT.\"\nI broke down pretty bad and the both of them just kept going on and on about what terrible things will happen to my siblings.\n\n\nThe entire my step-dad dragging me out of the house literally and telling me to \"GET THE FUCK OUT I DON'T EVEN WANT TO LOOK AT YOU\". \n\n\nMM likes to say she tried prying him off me. She likes to say she stood up for me.\n\n\nShe didn't. She tried getting me to live at step-dad's mom's house while she \"smooth things over with him\".\nI was sobbing in the car when I was kicked out. She didn't comfort me. She didn't look at me. She just kept calling other people. She left the car to stop him from throwing out my things as well.\n\nI ended up being put back at that house after living at a friend's for a little bit.\n\nI graduated high school and wanted so badly to go to college.\nMM tried setting me up for a trade school (I have nothing against them) but I kept insisting that I really wanted to go to college.\n\n\nShe basically tried telling me something along the lines of I'm not as smart as her (who was the first on her side of the family to go to college) and that I wouldn't make it.\n\nA lot of mess happened in college that wasn't entirely mom's fault.\n\n\nThis was just a bad/rough time in my life in general.\n\nI graduate college, show MM my degree, she gets a big grin on her face.\n\n\nShe rubs my degree almost literally in her ex's (ex-step dad's) face. Since he never finished college but I did.\nShe posted all over the book of faces how proud she was.\n\n\nI don't ever remember her telling me she was proud of me for graduating.\nI don't remember my mom ever telling me she was proud of me.\n\n\n\nI mean, I know my bio dad wasn't much better than my mom. But this is a shitty mom/mother in law subreddit. I think I just realized just how badly I've wanted a real mom, from a young age, and have started the first step to accepting I don't really have that.\nI live with my mom right now because she has a hard time paying for the 3 kids she had with ex-step-dad and also taking care of the house.  I also had literally no where else to go thanks to a crazy ex-roommate who almost shot her bf and the rest of us living there. I'm sure once I move out again (when the pandemic is over) everything will go to shit again.\nBut at least I'll finally be too far away for her to show up at my door and demand for my help.\n\n"}, {"title": "The Beginning of the End: SMIL Edition (super long)  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "147", "comments": "15", "content": "I have mostly talked about my JNMIL but I\u2019m back with the beginning of the story of why we no longer talk to DH\u2019s other side, JNSMIL/JNFIL. (On mobile, no one has permission to use my post in any way). This also happened over a year ago but within the last few years.\nDH and I lived with FIL and SMIL (briefly). We were trying to get back on our feet after a tough year. I had met them only a handful of times before we moved in. I knew them, but not super well. I was and still am super grateful that they allowed us to live with them for a little while.\nThings were great up until I got pregnant. Which was shortly after we got engaged while still living with them. I had severe morning sickness and I had to go on meds for it. This had me basically bed ridden for months. Throwing up several times a day and 24/7 nausea is not fun. I also had severe anxiety during my pregnancy (hmm I wonder why? /s) so I was just struggling all around.\nAnyways, one day we got a food item that I had been craving for weeks and I was finally able to stomach eating. I have no problem sharing and had been sharing lots of food the entire time living with them. But this particular day I was super irritable (those hormones were no joke lol) and someone ate some of my craving food. I was extra annoyed at this particular incident because no one bothered to ask me or even let me know but it wasn\u2019t a huge deal. I called and vented to DF and then let it go. Even laughed at myself shortly after for getting that annoyed over food. \nSMIL watches SIL\u2019s kids often and if I had special food or drink items (literally could only keep down certain things) the kids usually ate or drank them. I had no issues with this. I think one time I had mentioned to DF that we needed to get more of something the kids drank but I was in no way upset over this. These things could be and were repurchased. \nSo DF comes home to a calmer me and he brings up the food issue. I tell him to let it go because we are living in their house, I don\u2019t want them to feel disrespected in their own home and also that it wasn\u2019t anything to make a big deal out of, I was fine now. I also knew his SM well enough at this point to know she would blow up over something like this anyways. \nSo he promises he won\u2019t say anything (I think he was frustrated for me because he had seen me so sick for so long) and we go to sleep. \nNext morning, I wake up to an already awake DF who looks super guilty and annoyed. I ask him what\u2019s wrong and he tells me that he decided to talk to his parents about the food that had been eaten the night before. My heart sunk. I knew what he was going to say next and I felt like he betrayed my trust by going behind my back even though we agreed not to bring it up. \nHe tells me that the conversation did not go as planned and SMIL is LIVID at this point. She hadn\u2019t verbally said that she was upset but she\u2019s one of those people where you can just tell. I tell him that I am disappointed in his decision to do this especially while I was sleeping and not there to explain the situation or defend myself. \nI don\u2019t see SMIL or FIL yet but I have to start work (work from home) so I go into my office and get to work. Early afternoon rolls around and usually my in-laws pop in to say good morning by this time but not that day. DF comes into my office and says \u201cyeah SMIL has confirmed that she is mad\u201d. I just look at him and said, \u201cyou created the problem now you need to fix it. I was sleeping and did not agree to nor do I want to be involved\u201d. He said he tried but she just snapped at him and was already starting to twist what he said and put words in his mouth.\nSMIL had then commanded FIL to go out immediately after their talk and buy EVERYTHING they ate of mine over the past few weeks. Then she went through ALL of the food in the house and separated our food from theirs, took everything that was ours and put it all in the refrigerator in their garage. She also had our nieces and nephews ask DF and I every time they wanted to eat something that we bought (wtf, the kids should have not been involved at all). \nIt was all super awkward. That night DF had to go to work and I was dreading being home alone with them. They completely ignored my existence the entire day and continued icing me out that night and for the next two weeks.\nWe decided to move out that day and found an apartment within the week. We told the in-laws the week when they decided to acknowledge me again. They were actually surprised which surprised me lol SMIL almost looked offended. \nThe day we were moving out, SMIL finally decides to \u201ctalk\u201d to me/us about what happened. She started the conversation with \u201cI hold a grudge\u201d and I immediately knew this wasn\u2019t a \u201clet\u2019s make amends\u201d conversation. It was a \u201cfuck you! and here\u2019s why\u201d conversation. Pointing fingers and all that jazz...oh was I right. \nShe spent 20 minutes berating me. Over analyzing anything that I had ever said in the past. For example, one time I told her \u201cman I love pickles and now that I\u2019m pregnant I can\u2019t stop eating them\u201d. She brought that up during this \u201ctalk\u201d and started going on about how that was my passive aggressive way of confronting her about them eating my jar of pickles (which I literally didn\u2019t even notice had been eaten until that very moment). I said \u201cthose are not my words and that is not how I feel about it\u201d but she just glared at me with a smug look on her face like she just outed me or something. I said \u201cit was wrong for DF to go behind my back and share what was a private conversation between him and I, especially since I wasn\u2019t there to be a part of the conversation. I didn\u2019t want to offend anyone so I asked him to let it go. I\u2019m sorry. There has been a lot of miscommunication\u201d She turned to DF and said \u201cyou were totally right in telling me\u201d. Um, excuse me? Do not fucking undermine me and do not meddle in my relationship. I was jaded and just said \u201cit isn\u2019t a big deal, it never was a big deal and if I was truly that bothered by it I would have come to you myself. But I was just having a moment of irritability and that\u2019s that. Nothing more.\u201d She basically said that I was lying and insisting that I did think it was a bigger deal than I let on. So I just walked away and started packing the second she turned to DF to talk to him.\nWe moved out and nothing was resolved. She did not apologize for treating me like shit for two weeks because she was mad that I was mildly annoyed once. \nI might of been the asshole here but I know I did not deserve to be treated the way they treated me. \nThis incident seems stupid in grand scheme of things but it caused a lot of unnecessary pain and headache. I went VLC with them from this point on until the day they decided to nuke their relationship with me for good. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t the last time they caused problems. They did their part in ruining my baby shower for me and eventually led themselves to NC after our final attempt to make amends. \nAs always, thank you for your support here and letting me vent.\nSide note: DF (now DH) has since apologized for his part in this, profusely. We have worked all that out over time. He has greatly improved on the supportive partner front so we are good.\nEdited to add: JNFIL originally tried to de-escalate the situation by pulling DF aside and telling him that JNSMIL is menopausal and she\u2019s just acting out because of hormones and that we should have just let her be passive aggressive without holding her accountable. He has, conveniently, since changed his tune.\n\n"}, {"title": "Druggie Diva does sometimes care and it bothers me  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "36", "comments": "1", "content": "Its an old story I'm about to tell. Druggie Diva is my addict mom with a personality disorder that I'm NC with. See previous posts why. \nNow this happened when Druggie Diva was sober. She was getting ready for bed early for her (so like midnight) when someone rang her doorbell. It turned out a girl about 16 had been kicked out of her mom's car and she needed a ride to a friends. Druggie Diva straight up asked her, \"how do you know you can trust me?\" And the girl started crying and said she couldn't but only her porch light was on and she couldn't walk to her friends place as it was too far (probably true, she lives in a rural area). Cell phones weren't as common back then either so it was definitely believable. So Druggie Diva grabbed her keys and drove her to a friends house.\nTbh I think she saw my sister and me in the girl, because she called as soon as she was home (husband worked swing back then so we didn't go to bed until like 6 am) because Druggie Diva had often kicked my sister and me out of the house when mad. I think it shocked her to realize to a better extent exactly why it was so traumatic, but I don't think she was ever truly sorry. I think the reality check made her question herself, and it was that (narcissism is one of the symptoms of her diagnosis) that made her feel bad since she doesn't really question herself. It was just very surreal hearing her so upset over something she'd done to me with no apology. \nIt's a short story, I know, but it's been weighing on me lately. I know the relapse has compounded her problems but she's still very self absorbed and annoying when sober, its just not a dangerous thing.\n\n"}, {"title": "So... Is this common with evil MILs?

She went on to try and financially sabotage him shortly afterward, but that's all resolved\u2014I won't bother going into it because it's just annoying and typical. I have another grievance that has plagued my stomach since it was told to me.\nA couple of nights after the falling out with his mother, my husband tearfully revealed a lot of heartbreaking and gruesome details to me, concerning his childhood. The horrific spats, the relentless gaslighting, the psychological abuse he suffered at the hands of his mother. \nHe confessed to me that as a kid, he had a debilitating fear of the dark (in part due his mother convicing him that monsters were real) and he slept with her in his parents' bed for way too long\u2026 Until he was twelve. He was super embarrassed by it; It was a dirty little secret that he had to keep from everybody he knew, lest he be mocked and ridiculed ceaselessly by his peers. \nOne day, he had enough and declared to his mother that he would be sleeping in his own room from now on. There was already a room designated for him, with a bed and everything, it was just unused. Space was never a problem.\nYou know what she told him, in response? \nShe said: \"Oh, no you won't! If you do, I won't let you see your friends ever again.\" \nWhat in the ever-loving fuck? Bitch, it's not normal to sleep in the same bed as your twelve-year-old son every night, especially when he's uncomfortable with it. You want to isolate him even further for seeking out some autonomy in the house? \nDon't get me wrong, I don't think anything's inherently wrong with it. I was a frightful child who was denied comfort over and over by my parents, so I understand the appeal of sharing a bed when you have a nightmare or whatever... But this is next level creepy to me. The line, for me, is drawn when sharing beds is for the parent's emotional state, rather than the child's. \nShe was 100% serious, too. She was enraged that he didn't want to share a bed with her anymore, and took it as if he was rejecting her? I guess?\nNevertheless, he held his ground. Apparently, that was the first time he ever stood up to her and he started sleeping in his own room from then on. She didn't follow through on her threats to erase his social life.\nI have a suspicion that she felt rejected by him ever since, and I suspect that she was trying to fill the voids in her strained marriage with her son. It gives me such a creepy feeling. I came here to ask if this sort of thing happened to your DHs as kids\u2026 Where their mothers rasied them like fucking serial killers.\n\n"}, {"title": "JNMIL REFUSES TO STAY AWAY covid19 (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "697", "comments": "133", "content": "My children are immune compromised and this lady (shes a rn for godsake) is trying to come over every weekend (am i a total jerk for practically BEGGING my husband to please tell her no?)

Long-time reader, first-time poster here! I have had MANY grievances with my FMIL but nothing that I have not been able to resolve myself. Typically these issues stem from her babying my boyfriend to \u201cmakeup\u201d for her being absent from his life before the age of 13. (Seriously ya\u2019ll, up until we graduated high school she color coded his closet for him.) Him and I have been living together for years and I do NOT baby him. I do help him organize his important documents, banking statements, and so on if he asks for my help and since he is extremely disorganized. \nRecently, we have opened him a new bank account at a separate bank that his mother does not have access to due to past issues of her \u201cjust dipping\u201d into his past bank account to pay herself back for petty things such as meals or snacks she would purchase him. Like most banks, this one requires passwords, security questions, username, email, the works right? Well, my boyfriend did not write down any of this information mistakenly believing that he would remember it. We are in town with his mother for a visit and he could not view his account online which resulted in an hour long call with an automated voicemail to disappointingly arrive at a security question that he answered wrongly so he was locked out of his account. (I will preface this by saying we are both assholes by nature and poke fun, in good spirit, at one another to make light of most situations.) I respond with this to letting out a sigh and saying something along the lines of \u201cwho even lets you out of the house in the morning? Are you even wearing matching socks?\u201d - he wasn\u2019t. \nA week later, after his mother had flown 5 states away (she\u2019s a travel nurse), she messages me thanking me for spending time with them and then begins to express how I remind her of her past self and then says that I am organized, short fused, irritated, and a grudge holder. She then proceeds to tell me that if I am uncomfortable with hearing this information to tell her to butt-out but that she did have book recommendations for me. I did respond with an open heart and said I would be open to recommendations as I do suffer from OCD and ADHD and do not always recognize the \u201cnorm\u201d of how to approach certain situations. She, a bible beating baptist and avid conservative, began to send me, a Catholic raised and Latina immigrant democrat, paragraphs on how I have zero respect for \u201cmy man\u201d paired with book recommendations galore, my favorite being: \u2018MAN LEADS...woman follows, Everyone wins.\u2019 Then came the list that I had not been following that she urged me that if I took all of them to heart that I would make her son happy. This list consists of 25 rules that completely invalidate a woman\u2019s sense of self and morph her into a doormat for men with woman\u2019s purpose being to please her man highlighted in EVERY one of these books. I did not engage and have not responded. Initially, I did not express this conversation to my boyfriend but it was weighing heavily on my mind. I read him the texts and was questioning why she is assuming these terrible things about my character and then he mentions that she pulled him to the side after the whole bank \u201cincident\u201d and expressed distaste at my comments which he responded with saying that he makes similar comments directed towards me as well, it\u2019s just how we flirt and giggle over one another\u2019s faults that are sometimes frustrating. She decided to address her distaste with me regardless and now I am wondering how terrible of a person I must be for her to make such bold assumptions about my character in a matter of two days. I am extremely quiet around her because I do not feel comfortable and I feel like I am being psychoanalyzed with every word and action around her. I am wondering if it is just me? I know I have a complex because of my ADHD that makes me feel like slight disapproval is actually rejection and hatred but I genuinely believe that she does not like me and our differences in beliefs is furthering the wedge between us as I cannot fathom not being an independent woman and letting \u201cmy man lead.\u201d He barely wears underwear outside of the house! Am I overreacting about feeling like she is searching for reasons to not like me? He says she would never hate me and loves me but this surely does not feel like love.

No got there 10 minutes before me (they were meant to be there 20 minutes before the bride)\nThey only left because my MAKE UP ARTIST yes my PAID professional screamed at them to leave (no lie I gave her a hefty tip of \u00a3200 just for it, it was beautiful)\nBecause they made us late we didn\u2019t have enough time to get photos with them Inside the venue like we did with my family (As I sad I had less people and it made for quick photos took a total of 15 seconds) there was another wedding within 20 mins and they needed to sort the interior so was booted so couldn\u2019t get photos with them inside (if they was on time we would of had an extra 5 mins)\nWe did however get loads of photos with them outside !\nOur \u201cReception\u201d rolls around and I come to find out they spent \u00a3300+ on food, and then were mad that no one was staying, I said I warned them (They also got SPICY foods which I cannot eat due to health) so I went hungry at my own party?\nIts chuckin down with rain they\u2019re trying to BBQ my family is knackered and my friend leaves because my mother in law keeps trying to get people to drink. My sister was borderline sobbing and I said she could leave which meant my grandpa drove him and my sister and half sister home. THIS triggered my MIL she said it was rude I ignored her and got out my dress wiped off my make up put on some comfy clothes and my husband says \u201cGod You\u2019re so beautiful \u201c she then rages because I took off my dress before the Extended family can get photos with me ?\nMy husband starts packing the car up and I\u2019m so excited to spend 4 days alone with him in a secluded cabin. I was ecstatic!\nI\u2019m saying bye to my son he\u2019s so excited he gets to spend a few days with the in laws especially his uncles (no issues here my mil can be ott but she adores my son and would never ever ever endanger him)\nAs we say bye my MIL asks where we are going and we explain She breaks down crying saying FIL had gone to pick up our cake and would be so disappointed in us for leaving. This triggered my husband, He went from 0-100 so fast and just said we was leaving we kissed our son and left.\nWe had an amazing honeymoon, It was honestly so beautiful, we went horseback riding, water park, themepark, late night drives, went to a drive in cinema, baked, had take outs, played board games and obviously a lot of intimacy!\nWe came back and my FIL was fine but she was sulking and of course because barely anyone came there was loads of cake left and food. Yep you guessed it I gained my 2 dress sizes back through the cake and got incredibly sick from the spicy food.\nIm STILL working on losing it.\nShe occasionally says how horrible I was for not letting them get pictures in the venue with us, how i ruined the party by getting out my dress and make up, How We was ungrateful for not staying around etc.\nIt has been 10 months and I am still deeply upset over it. thankfully we now live over 4hours away and I deeply love my husband and he is ALWAYS team US not team MIL thankfully and 0 fog.\nI feel I am OTT on this topic but everytime I think of my wedding I just cringe..\nMy sister and friend were so upset and offended and my Husband is still upset that she brought cake etc...\n(Again my family didn\u2019t want an after party and neither did we and my kid didn\u2019t care he was 2)\nHow do you guys handle feelings with big important things like this? At the end of the day I am happy I married my husband but Even he is still moody over it ...\n\n"}, {"title": "Mil tried and failed \ud83d\ude02  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "3449", "comments": "167", "content": "TLDR: MIL didn\u2019t like my boundaries, tried to call the hospital herself and was told DH wasn\u2019t there or even a patient.

I get down stairs to make lunch and get some drinks. I hear RD talk about some supplement that is supposed to help with the big Covid, apparently some doctor was talking about it. So MIL goes online to find said supplement, which has doubled in price. MIL pissed, FIL angry at society, and I just want my damn cappuccino. I try to not merge in this conversation, but ofcourse MIL wants my opinion since I studied laboratory techniques and have proved her wrong a few times. \nI have noticed how she gets people to agree with her outrageous claims. She makes the outrageous claim, someone says she is wrong, and that person telling her she is wrong would mean you think she is insane, an idiot and should just die.

(self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "16", "comments": "8", "content": "Hi everyone. On my phone so apologies about formatting.\nI've posted before from my main account regarding my FMIL, but I'm here today to talk about my mum. I'm on an alternative account because I use the username on my main account for a lot of other things and I would be known to my family if they saw it.\nMy mum isn't as bad as my FMIL but she definitely has Just No tendencies. I don't think I help in certain situations because I am very stubborn, but I will admit to that now. My mum is also menopausal which I don't think helps either. And, we are also in lock down which I think is making the whole thing 10x worse. But, I just need to post about it here, maybe get some reassurance or be told that I'm the issue. Just a vent to be fair - I know this is a supportive community.\nSo, as I said above, my mum has some Just No tendencies. I've been able to see this and admit this for about 6 months to a year. Being in this group and seeing some of the things that you guys are going through and also, seeing my FMIL has made me realise this.\nI may refer to \"us\" throughout this post and that is myself and my FD(dear)H\nA bit of background:\nFDH and I live with my parents. FDH moved in with us four years ago. We are getting married next year (everything permitting) and are planning to start a family straight after this. The current plan is to live with my parents throughout all of the above while saving for a house and then buy a house and move out.\nI don't even know where to start... Here we go.\nMy mum will commonly ask us to send a message to family members or friends, even when she has her own mobile in her hands.\nShe volunteers us for stuff, without asking us first. The most recent case of this has been to go shopping for family members during the lockdown. I am an essential worker so get specific hours to go shopping when the general public isn't allowed in the shop. Because of this, I have been doing the shopping, which I don't mind but it means I have to get up an hour earlier than needed to go shopping before I go to work. Which again, I don't mind but I'd like to choose which days I have to get up earlier so I can make sure I am getting enough sleep the night before.\nI come home from work one evening and my mum is talking about me going shopping and getting bits for my nans. I ask if I have already been volunteered for this or if I get to choose. My mum's response to this is \"god forbid you want to help family\". \nMy FDH and I don't do much just ourselves. We are very family orientated and love spending time with our families. But, every now and then we like to do stuff on our own.\nOver the Christmas period, we did do a few things just us two.\nWe went to see the new Star Wars film, and we are both quite big fans so decided to do the triple bill - watching the two beforehand, then be there for the midnight viewing for the new one. My mum has expressed that she isn't fond of midnight viewings on work nights and also that she wouldn't want to sit through multiple films so we didn't extend an invite. When we mentioned going, she was grumpy but didn't say anything.\nWe were invited to a local shopping centre by FDHs friends between Christmas and New year. We agreed to go and let my mum know. She got grumpy at this but didn't say anything. We had a great day with FDHs friends.\nWhen we come home, mum was still in a mood but didn't say anything. The mood continued for a few days afterwards.\nI can't remember if I mentioned something or she did but we eventually got talking about FDH and I going out. Mum mentioned that she thought there would be an invite to the local shopping centre and I said that FDHs friends had invited us so didn't feel right extending the invite. Mum said that she would have been happy to walk around on her own but I said I would never have invited her and asked that of her. She then brought up the cinema, saying that we didn't mention anything and that an invite would have been nice. It all ended with her asking if we like doing stuff with her anymore which I responded yes but FDH and I hardly ever do anything just us two and she didn't respond.\nThere haven't been any situations like the above since but I have said to FDH that it'd be good if we did more stuff with just each other after lock down and I am not sure how that will go down.\nOther situations include wedding planning. We are getting married legally on one day and then having a family celebration on another. Because of this, I have two sets of bridesmaids.\nI didn't have a joint group for all of them initially and was just discussing stuff individually.\nWe had ordered the bridesmaids dresses and they had arrived. Funnily, we had received face masks with the dresses which my mum wanted to post to all of the bridesmaids. She said I should have a group for all of them but I didn't want this. She said she was going to make one herself to which I responded that it is my wedding and I will make groups myself. This caused her to get grumpy. She had already posted the picture to a group with some of the bridesmaids in, but hadn't said anything to go with it. I asked why she hadn't said anything and she said \"I didn't think it was my place as it is not my wedding\". This was said in a very grumpy voice and it wasn't meant sincerely.\nMy FDH is furloughed currently and my mum is also, so they are spending a lot of time together. They get on most of the time but their personalities can definitely clash sometimes. This is causing a lot of stress on FDH.\nThey were having a conversation the other day, and my mum said to him \"you and Neon never speak\" and this took him back a little. We do speak, but we have private conversation in our bedroom and the only time we go up to our bedroom is when we are going to bed.\nI know there's definitely more, but I can't think off the top of my head.\nAll of this is very hard for me to write, because it makes me feel like suggesting that FDH and I move out after our wedding. This would obviously put us in a more difficult financial position but I'm wondering if it would be better for us as newly weds.\nI also know that suggesting that will break my mum's heart, and I think that there may be a chance that my mum would change if it was suggested.\nI really don't have the guts to brave the conversation with her though, as I know it will cause heart ache and I don't know if she will react angrily or sadly.\nSorry for the long post! Any advice would be greatly appreciated. If I'm the issue, just let me know and I will gladly take on any advice to change or help ease the situation.\n\n"}, {"title": "JNGMA and grief pains  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "47", "comments": "5", "content": "TLDR: my JNGMA and JNfamily has flipped their marbles since my aunt got diagnosed with cancer (May 2019) and passed away (October 2019)\nSo I\u2019ve been lurking in this subreddit for a while now, not sure why I found such comfort in hearing everyone else\u2019s experiences. \nI have a great relationship with my mom, even though as a child it was tough. She won her battle with addiction 6 years ago and has been sober ever since. There is no one I trust more than my mom. We have an open-ear policy, truly nonjudgmental relationship because I saw her at her absolute worse through her addiction issues. She\u2019s also Christian, and I am bisexual, spiritual but not religious. Our differences only bring us closer together, we\u2019ve had nothing but love and support for each other since I turned 18 and started my adventure into adulthood. I\u2019m now 21 and I\u2019ve struggled quite a lot, I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression as 12 years old. \nMy JNGMA took over raising me during the moments my mom was unable to care for me because of her addiction. My dad was absent and happy to pass off his responsibilities onto his mother. My older brother (24M) has never had a job or a driver\u2019s license and is completely dependent upon my JNGMA. \nMy dad, after my aunt was first diagnosed with cancer, first got pulled into the drama by my older brother who didn\u2019t want me around after my grandparents moved into my aunts house to help take care of her. He accused me of stealing, but what did I steal? Pizza. Rolls. In a house with a full fridge of plenty of other food. He walks outside while I\u2019m about to leave the driveway and tells me to give them back. I said \u201cuh, no? I\u2019m hungry.\u201d I took them to eat at a friends house and watch a movie, which got interrupted by a call from my dad threatening to beat me if I went back to the house and telling me he told my brother to lock the door and not let me back inside. After I recovered from the panic attack I was having, I explain to him I didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d them I was just hungry and only ate half the bag. I\u2019d bring back the rest and put it in the freezer. That was only the begging of a lot of ridiculous toxicity. \nI came home a few weeks later with a note from my dad telling me to find another place to live. The AUDACITY considering he has never been apart of my life unless it was to be judgemental or abuse me. And so came months and months of emotional and verbal abuse from my JNDad, JNStepmom, JNBro and JNGMA. My JYGPA is the only reason I didn\u2019t end up homeless, because he stood up for me. \nHowever my JNGMA continued to accuse me of stealing, which only got worse after my aunt\u2019s passing. She was a upper-middle class business woman, and apparently I had a reason to steal her expensive things?\nThe accusations continued to escalate after my JNGMA cornering me for more abuse anytime my JYGPA wasn\u2019t in the house. \nI got accused of giving my 11 year old half-sister stolen perfume for her birthday, in which she overheard the conversation and now all of my little siblings believe I\u2019ve been stealing my aunts things, because the toxic \u201cadults are always right\u201d attitude they all have. \nThat was the last straw for me, during this I\u2019d been struggling to save enough money for a place to live. I got my covid19 stimulus check and moved into a dorm style apartment. \nI still find myself hurting a lot from everything that happened and wishing I could have changed things even though there no changing their toxicity. The part that breaks my heart the most is that I no longer have a relationship with my little sibling because it them. \nI was having therapy twice a week, and now with the outbreak I\u2019m lucky if I get one zoom call a week with my therapist. \nJust looking for some support here, thank you for reading\n\n"}, {"title": "Territorial baby hog  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "230", "comments": "98", "content": "Need to vent, open to opinions/advice!\nWhenever we have dinner with the in-laws, MIL is baby talking with LO the whole time and SO and FIL are having their own convo (cars or guns are literally all they talk about) while I\u2019m just sitting there.

We need a name for MIL. For now I am updating and marking AAA just because I don\u2019t see that there\u2019s anything more I can do about anything with this woman. Until the next time- which I\u2019m 99% there will be a next time. However I suppose this is also happens to deal with my own JMMom, so feel free to hit on that. \nMoving on: so, we\u2019re still under quarantine however they\u2019ve lifted some restrictions- only giving this bit of info because relevant. But MIL showed up to the house a few days ago. Ironically the day before she showed I noticed she\u2019d deleted me off bookface which kind of grinded my gears but I digress. Anyways she shows up in the late morning however we (SO, LO, me) were sleeping when suddenly I wake bevause SO has rushedly put clothes on and bolted out the door. All of a sudden I hear my JMMom from outside the door asking why MIL is here and if my mom should bring LO down to see her. As soon as she said that I could hear MIL screaming outside, apparently they were on the corner of the block. I didn\u2019t prod SO for much but essentially what went down was: he gave her the ring back, asked her if she wanted to see LO, she refused multiple times, said we weren\u2019t family. Claimed she\u2019d unfriended me from bookface on Christmas which is a blatant lie but okurrt. Go off sis. \ud83e\udd2f so after that she hands SO a card she got for LO for Christmas and went off some more and left. She took a bus to us btw, we could\u2019ve offered her a ride but if you\u2019ve seen any of my post history you could understand why neither SO or I were keen to chase her down, plus honestly would rather not have all the extra germs in our vehicle, just because restrictions have lifted a bit doesn\u2019t negate the fact the confirmed COVID cases are rising in our area but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \nAnyways this leads me on to afterwards, my own mother. She is not unaware of my MIL\u2019s antics by ANY means at all. She knows everything I do about her. When I went down to tell her everything that happened she responded with how she understood why MIL was upset- because of one of my SIL\u2019s and a lack of us seeing SIL or her seeing LO. (MIL\u2019s also been claiming malpractice against literally every medical facility SIL has been in which is I suppose a separate post for a separate day. Plus from my limited knowledge I really will be honest and can\u2019t say I can\u2019t believe nor disbelieve these claims as frankly I am too biased to say and I\u2019m not there to witness). I express I completely understand why she is hurt and we have reached out to try to see her (before pandemic) but she\u2019s stood us up. I also asked if it would be wrong of me to want to withhold LO from her in the future based off how she\u2019s acted towards me (mostly to see her response so I could better understand her mindset). \nSide note, skip if interested: I finally managed to find a word to use about how this whole ordeal has made me feel, and truthfully I feel kind of betrayed by MIL? I know the woman is flawed to hell and back and her issues do not excuse her actions, but I do love the woman for what it\u2019s worth. I enjoyed time we spent together when we did, and honestly I felt kind of special. But now she has somehow turned everything on me and both me and SO are besides ourselves about it. Okay /end side note.\nMy mother responded to that question like \u201cwhy would you do that? She\u2019s LO\u2019s grandmother! Why would you deprive LO of a relationship with her? When he\u2019s old enough he will see for himself how she is but how would you feel if we deprived you of a relationship with your grandparents?\u201d Which is frankly an excellent question so I responded, I did kind of go through that and I don\u2019t mind. Clearly she knew this but my fellow quarantiner\u2019s dont- my dad was adopted, found out his BIO family later in life and knew who they were and met them, but I never grew close but knew of them. I personally don\u2019t feel I missed out on anything because the grandparents I had were/are spectacular. My dad then interjected countering my mother\u2019s arguments but still my mom persisted and said if I don\u2019t ask my SO she will, but she wants to know if she has permission to get his mom this weekend if she agrees and go with LO to the park and do social distancing. Frankly I think not, my dad thinks not, I\u2019m sure my SO thinks not. So humor me my fellows- what do you think? \ud83d\ude02\nEdit: in some good news my mother took the hint and apologized. She does still think we should try to patch things up with MIL but she knows it\u2019s up to us. I do want to say, since I forgot to mention, my SO has essentially dropped the rope. He wants to keep the line of communication open by not blocking her, however he won\u2019t be responding to any nasty messages. It\u2019s a game of waiting now because she will inevitably come back. The woman has many mental health issues and would never be left alone with LO regardless of what terms we\u2019re on with her. While her issues are not an excuse, there are ways she can healthily work on them. If ever in the future she decides she\u2019s ready to apologize (because she does and has done this so often, just not for this long, and it\u2019s also the first time she\u2019s dragged me into it let alone my child) then I need some things to have SO tell her need to change and how to word it in a productive manner. Any thoughts? Here are some things I would love to see change/happen, let me know your thoughts or well, anything else to tack on. Her giving parenting advice and hovering is not an issue with her so far but if an inch is ever given she\u2019s the type to RUN the damn mile, so I also want some moving in the future type stuff as well.\n\u2022 Frankly, plays favorites with her kids and grand kids. It\u2019s gotta stop.\n\u2022 The unreasonable reactions and frankly toxic responses? Gotta stop, gotta learn to cope or talk it out.

He\u2019s out of the fog in the sense of knowing how horrible she can be and he hates it but naturally he still wants his mom to be his mom. He will try until he truly can\u2019t anymore and with this involving LO I think he\u2019ll mull over it.\nLastly, thank you all so much for reading and leaving your comments. I read every one of them and talk them over with my SO without really saying they\u2019re comments lol, but it is always appreciated.\n\n"}, {"title": "Delusional Deana & The Wedding Day  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "608", "comments": "34", "content": "I don\u2019t consent to my posts being used in any other forum but Reddit .\nMy Mom and I are super close. She is the best Mother anyone could ask for. Mess with her or her family and be prepared to get got. She once told my BF (now Husband) that if he ever put his hands on me, they would find pieces of him all over the County. Of course my SO told me what went down but he said he didn\u2019t mind because he liked my Mom; \u201cyour Mom doesn\u2019t fuck around\u201d. \nBecause I know my Mom so well I\u2019ve only shared certain things with her regarding my mother in law. I didn\u2019t want her to worry about me or feel like she had to step in on my behalf against Delusional Deana and her antics. She taught me young how to handle myself and I figured I was doing ok on my own. \nFor years, Deana was always asking when she would get to meet my Mom. My Husband had brought GMIL with him to my family gatherings for years and years but never wanted Deana to join the mix. He said she\u2019d just embarrass him. I don\u2019t blame the guy, I mean she\u2019s a piece of work for sure. You can\u2019t bring her anywhere ever because she doesn\u2019t know how to be normal (for lack of a better word). My family is nice but they aren\u2019t that nice.\nThe first time Deana met my Mom was on our Wedding Day. The morning of, my Mom, Sister and I were getting ready in our Airbnb when my phone kept going off with text messages. Surprise! It was Deana. She was asking me all the questions: What time was the service again? Does she have to walk far after parking? How are we getting there? She doesn\u2019t like ethnic food; Do they have normal food at the restaurant? She can get a ride there but she\u2019ll need a ride back home. This Bitch.\nAll of the answers to her incessant questions were sitting on her phone via text message e-vites her Son and I sent out a week before the big day. I sent screenshots of the texts to my Fianc\u00e9 and asked him to get back to her. He wasn\u2019t happy she was starting her crap so early in the day. My Mom asked me why she was asking me all these questions when we sent everyone all the info already. I told her this is Deana\u2019s MO. My Mom shook her head. I guess my Fianc\u00e9 saw to her questions because later Deana sent me a text basically saying sorry she bothered me.\nWe had a courthouse wedding and contracted an officiant and photographer for the event. In each of their questionnaires they had a similar question that asked if there were any sensitive relationships they should be aware of : example- step parent, widow(er), estranged family member etc. We mentioned Deana in there and put down that if she made them uncomfortable or got in their way to please let us know, we would see to it. The officiant asked to be introduced to her before the ceremony and the photographer asked my SO to point her out the day of.\nMy family and I arrived at the courthouse. SO and his family were already in the courtroom, sitting down waiting for the ceremony to start. My family went to find their seats while my Sister and I went to the restroom. I guess while we were in there my Mom asked my SO to introduce her to Deana. My SO said he walked my Mom to Deana and before he could say anything my Mom introduced herself as \u201cThe Bruja\u2019s Mother\u201d and that she must be Deana.\nMy Mom shook her hand and told her it was nice to finally put a face to a name. My Mom told me Deana was shook.\nBruja means Witch in Spanish. A couple years before we got married, Deana started referring to me as a Bruja behind my back to my Fianc\u00e9 after she and I got into an argument.\nBefore our service we had told everyone attending that we would have someone recording the ceremony and photographing it. We asked them to please avoid getting in the way during the days events and that any/all photos and videos would be available to them later. Of course, none of those requests applied to Deana, so she did what she does; she got in the way, and did her own thing. \nDeana got in the way when my Father was walking me in. She was taking pictures or video with her phone. My Sister was very annoyed with her and asked her to please take a seat because she was in the way of the photographer. Deana told my Sister that she was just getting some pictures for FB. Sister told Deana she was sure that my Husband and I said that there were to be no posts on FB. Deana pouted but went and sat down.  We have the moment on video. You can\u2019t  hear them talking but Deana\u2019s face is obvious.\nAfter the ceremony was over, Deana started loudly crying (no tears) and hanging all over my Husband. She then gave me one of her lingering hugs and kept trying to rub her face on my dress shoulder. Bish, please. My Mom was watching Deana do this and interrupted her so she could give me her own hug. \nPicture time came and that\u2019s when Deana really amped up her bullshit. We had to ask her multiple times to get out of the way, stop hovering behind the photographer and to stop taking her own pictures. When it was time for our group photo with her she asked if she looked ok and if her makeup was messed up. We said no. She turned to me, looked at me sideways, wrinkled her nose and said \u201cI always forget how dark you are.\u201d Colorism is still a huge thing in Hispanic culture and Deana has no shame in pointing out my skin tone. My Husband was trying to play it cool but I could feel that he was losing his patience. \nDeana was getting super bossy with the photographer, wanting to see each picture after she took it. At one point my Husband asked the photographer to hold on and give him a second. He pulled Deana aside and whispered something in her ear. She made a face and then walked off. \nI thought Deana would follow us around the grounds while we took pictures but whatever my Husband said to her pissed her off and we didn\u2019t see her until later when it was time to go to the reception. She blew up his phone asking us when we would be heading over to the restaurant because she would need a ride there. He was annoyed with her so he never answered her texts. He told me she carpooled with SIL1 and her Husband, she can figure out her ride situation on her own. \nWe arrived at the restaurant and Deana was already there with all the other guests. Guess she figured it out. Everyone was having a nice time and chatting back and forth. We could hear Deana complaining: about the restaurant, the food, how she wished SIL2 was there and all the grandkids, blah blah blah. After the drinks were served, stories were told and toasts were made. Beautiful things were said by our loved ones and Deana decided she needed to say something too. \nDeana stood up and said she would like to say something \ud83d\ude44. She said being a single mother is hard and that every mother hopes their child finds someone who is \u201cworthy\u201d. She never thought my Husband would ever marry because he dated \u201ca lot of pretty girls\u201d and he never wanted to be \u201ctied down\u201d. She said it was hard to lose her baby boy and she would miss him so much, but she knew he wouldn\u2019t \u201cbelong\u201d to her forever. She wished her Son all the happiness in the world and raised her glass. Awkward\nEveryone looked really uncomfortable after the speech so my Husband made one right after that hit hit right in the feels \ud83e\udd74. Later, after more drinks and talking with guests Deana approached me and said she wanted to talk to me in private. We went off to the side and she told me now that we are family she would like to start over. She said she knows that we are both strong women and that strong women clash. Eyeroll. She said she would like to keep the past in the past. I said I would be willing to do that but that didn\u2019t mean I was going to forget all the things she\u2019s done to me and that my responses are based on her behavior. I wasn\u2019t going to let her treat me like shit and sweep things under the rug like her children do. Deana said she would try to be better and that she wanted to be a part of her Son\u2019s life more. We wrapped up our conversation and returned to the reception.\nMy Husband and I have been married for 2 years and Deana is still Deana.

My MIL told him something among the lines of \"She is prettier than I expected\". To my face I never heard a compliment from her. \nI continued dating him, he is a sweetheart and did a lot of things to impress me. Still he was too enmeshed with his parents, living with them and the car he used belongs to them. \nSo if mommy or daddy were on a bad mood, that would mean a canceled date at the last moment for me. \nNot cool and I let him know. Still he swore I was the love of his life and he started to help me in any way he could. \nSo we got more serious, his mom started to invite me to dinner, the type of dinner where you are sitting uncomfortable while your host makes passive aggressive comments about you and you are low key interrogated. \nI'm from a far from perfect family and my dad made my life hell while my mom enabled him. I have had enough of people trying to control me and making me feel less for a couple life times. \nI set my boundaries and I gray rocked, he accepted them and he wanted to have his own boundaries with them because he had also had enough of being the family emotional punching bag. \nThe plan was to go away as soon as we could. \nThen we lost our jobs and the new ones we found are a work from home position, yay!.\nExcept the only house that had good internet connection to work at was his parent's house.\nNot yay. \nSo we needed to keep our heads down for more time, still I was not eating with his family, we bought food or I cooked, his \"room\" was almost a separate apartment just without kitchen. \nHis mom was not happy, she wanted us to eat with them and once, when a cousin visited, they vetoed me from the house for 10 days because it was family time. Thankfully I did not lose my job for that but still it was a big nail in the coffin of my good will to my MIL and in-laws.\nI avoided them as much as I could, I told my SO that I wanted to pay for the internet so they couldn't nag us about it but he refused. He told they were abusing of his good will enough. \nHis mom was getting angrier that I would not ate with them, she barked at me one time and my SO warned her not to mess with me, still she tried to talk to him into leaving me several times.\nOne day she exploded, offended because I just said \"hi\" from distance and not hugged her and kissed her in the cheek every time I saw her. According her I was being disrespectful and she used information (we had debt from our time jobless) that she got opening my SO's mail behind his back to get his FIL into bribing him to pay his debt but forbidding me from entering their house again.\nHe doubted for minutes what he should do (and that hurt) but now I'm happily writing from my house, he moved in with me and my mom, we got an office just for us to work and we already paid more than half our debt, bought new furniture and decorated our home and office.\nAt first he did not want to cut them off completely, when he first moved in he tried to keep tabs with them and they pretended to accept his choice and wished him well. Except for his mom, his mom just cried a lot.\nHis sister who, before him moving out was not close and laughed at him when he was given the ultimatum of leaving me, started to call him and his mom messaged him daily. When the quarantine started, she tried to forbid us to go out and buy groceries, she wanted us him to go to her house and she would bought us him what we he needed.\nOf course they didn't stop  throwing dirt on me, his grandmothers tried to guilt trip him and my MIL's mother questioned him about me and my \"way to behave\".\nThey expected him to go back home to fix the internet and to plug the printer, when his dad is a computer engineer.\nWe fought. He wanted to keep peace with them, I didn't understand fucking why after the shit they made us go through and how they still acted like a crazy ex girlfriend.\nSo he finally decides to stop answering.\nWe had a couple weeks of peace and happiness and then his sister's birthday arrived and he called her, we fought again. I could see his spine wavering from two miles away and he gaves me the reason but still wants to call them on their birthdays. His mom's birthday is on Chritmas evening and for two years in a row she made sure I couldn't see him on that date (and week) .\nWe are happy, I'm glad they kicked us out before the virus started but I'm having issues with the idea of having contact with them as low as it is because even when it is his choice to make I just can't forgive them.\nMy dad did his best to sabotage my life and I had to endure it because we were \"faaamily\" at the eyes of my mom (until she was the one being his only emotional and financial punch bag). Yes, it was probably wiser to do what my MIL wanted while we were at her home, but bloody hell I'm not going to kiss and hug someone that is trying to make me feel unwanted and less than her.\nSo, what should I do when the times comes and he wants to call them again?\nEdit to add\nI get that I could go NC, but I don't how to do it without feeling hurt. We are child free and less of a couple for his parents for this and they seem to be more than happy to pretend I do not exist in his son life and shoved him with little cousin like if there were trying to remember him he is going to miss out on having kids. \nHe is used to get upset with them but not to fight them or spoke up so when the flying monkeys started to talk trash me he got upset but did a really poor job of shooting them down. And while they didn't care before after we started living together they started to invite  him to expensive places that he likes.\nIf the virus would had start a couple months earlier I'm sure his mom would have used that as excuse to stop us from seeing each other and ban me from the house (so I would had lost my job thanks to her too).\nI know I can't and I should not try to control his relationship with them, but at what point I can cross a line? They are nothing except hurtful to me and going NC seems to me like a bad idea because his mom acts more like a ex trying to strain our relationship than a worried mom and I know that if I go NC she will more than happy, after all her messages that recognize I exist are asking him to not tell me something they want or did.\nI'm lost here.\n\n"}, {"title": "Mom Is Acting Normal  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "232", "comments": "11", "content": "I\u2019ve posted here several time where my mother would get on me about what I ate, made me do excessive chores, unfair treatment, etc. It got to the point where I moved to out to my friend\u2019s couch.

That call started the NC for me, and VLC for DH.  \nTo recap:  \nWe only asked for a break from hanging out due to feeling uncomfortable and hurt from her verbal abuse, but she decided to cut us off entirely. Because SHE was hurt by us only hanging out because we want something from her. (Uh, not at all true.) Fine by us. We did not hear a peep from her for the rest of 2018.  \nOn New Year's Day 2019 was her first text. Just a simple \"Happy New Year!\" to DH. We decided we would keep to our word and responded in kind, signing it from both of us. She definitely seemed less enthusiastic when my name was mentioned, as her next text lacked all the exclamation points and emojis her first one had. I do try not to read into that, but\u2026 :/  \nThroughout 2019 she would send random texts talking about how much she loved him (though she neglected to wish him a happy birthday). She sent him a meme of a moon that said \"To the moon and back. Remember?\" the day after mother's day, after DH had consciously decided not contact her. He did not respond.  \nThen, in May of last year, DH's dad told us the real story of his divorce with Fraaz. We had previously only heard her version of events, and, wouldn't you know it, EVERYTHING WAS A LIE. DH was understandably pissed. This made him realize that she's always been this way, and was not likely to change her shitty behavior. (I also pointed out that what she did was Parental Alienation) So he decided he was dropping the rope.  \nI've covered most of all that in previous posts. Now, let's get into the more recent stuff. This is going to be a bigger update.  \n\nAround January, I started to get the feeling like something was about to happen. I must spend too much time on this sub because she is laughably predictable to me. She wished us a happy Thanksgiving, but was silent for Xmas and New Years. Then\u2026  \nA month and half ago, Fraaz texts DH that she is refinancing her house and that she needs from us proof that we've paid our house payments on time for the last 12 months because she cosigned our home loan. (Yes. I know. We're definitely kicking ourselves now, but we have started the process to fix it. Ugh.)  \nDH was at work when he saw the texts, and she did say we didn't have to go through her and gave us her agent's info. He didn't respond immediately.  \nThe NEXT text he received, was her talking about how the last time she received a reply from my DH was to \"argue about his amazon account\" and was clearly meant to be sent to someone else. She sent another message right after saying she \"was sending to dad. Because I'm a little miffed. You know I love you and I'm not sure why you won't even respond to me\"  \nYeah. Okay. DH and I have already dissected these texts. He was getting annoyed with the whole thing, so he just responded, \"Because I was at work and haven't had a chance to look into it yet.\"  \nFraaz: \"You know I love you, and I miss you terribly!!\"  \nHe ignored that message. But he did help her get the info she needed to refinance. She offered to refer us to her agent so that we could also refinance our house at a cheap price. Yeah, that's hard NO.  \nShe texted a few more times after that.  \nonce to tell him to \"watch\" himself with the virus because he has asthma. He told her he was \"3 steps ahead of her on that one.\"\n*Another gushy meme pic saying \"You know that place between sleep and awake, that place where you still remember dreaming? That's where I'll always love you. That's where I'll be waiting.\" (that's not at all creepy) DH did not acknowledge that.\n*She then asked if he was off work and quarantined. We thought it might be fun to troll her with dumb gif responses. But she just said she was \"sooo confused?? Lol\"\n*A few minutes after that exchange, she said \"I'm sorry m an asshole..\" DH sent another gif reply of Ryan Reynolds nodding in agreement. She said \"Smiles!\" We just rolled our eyes.\n*Couple weeks after, she sent \"Just wanted to say I love you *heart emoji\" DH didn't reply.\nWished him a \"Happy Easter\" with a video of an animated baby chick. Again, no reply from DH.\n*Few weeks ago she asked him \"Did you get your deposit from the government yet?\" (We were both like, \"and why tf would we tell you that?\") Did not reply.\n*And the last text he received \"Love you *heart eyes emoji Nevermind me, but when is the last time you saw dad?\" Did not respond.  \nWe've pretty much been either gray rocking or just straight up ignoring her texts. DH has been really annoyed with all the \"love\" she's been sending. He said if she really did love him, she wouldn't have treated us so badly before and then act like she didn't. Grade A rugsweeping. Only we're not falling for it anymore.  \nAnd now, ALL of that brings us to today.  \nDH was checking his bank account to see if his partial unemployment had come in.  \nShe sent him a thousand dollars, with the note \"Happy belated birthday\".  \nWe have been discussing what to do. I had written this whole post, up to the fact that she had sent the 1k, before I thought to ask if she left a note. He hadn't checked before, and then found the email saying \"happy belated birthday\"  \nSo, our options we had thought of before finding the note were/are:  \n*Send the money back with a note saying just the word \"No.\"\n*Send the money back without saying anything.  \nWe still think it is the best option to just send her the money back, because we know that in accepting the cash, we are sending the message that we can be bought. We want to be clear that we don't need her money, since us \"only hanging out with her because we wanted something from her\" (i.e, mostly money. Also, still not true) was her retaliation to us trying to communicate to her how she'd hurt us.  \nSince finding the note, DH feels like it complicates the issue. I agree to a point, but I still think we should send it back. (But I also think it would be funny for him to message her to tell her he gave me all of it as a congratulations for getting promoted twice in 6 months at my job. DH likes this idea, but he suggests telling her he's going to use it to celebrate our 6 YEAR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.)  \nWe both are fully aware this is her love bombing and manipulating us. We spoke with FIL and he wants us to talk to her and give her another chance. (DH wants me to add that FIL specifically said the words, \"I just want everybody to get along.\" Which was the exact same thing DH used to say before realizing that that was impossible.) DH told him we tried that already and it didn't work. FIL is one of those \"But she's your MOOOOOOMMMMM\" kinds of people. Love the dude, but I'm kinda over him flipping between agreeing with us not talking to her and then telling us to \"start over from scratch.\"  \nThe thing is, though, DH and I are not opposed to trying to talk all of this out with her (emphasis on the 'trying' part). He's no longer confrontation avoidant about this, but he is nervous about not being able to say everything he needs to say. And we've already tried writing lists and scripts. Those only didn't work because she would yell over him.  \nIf we were to try to have a phone call with her now, we would set the expectation at the beginning that if she yells over us, or tries to lie to us, or throws a fit like last time, we would hang up and wouldn't be trying again. I can predict what she might do and I'm usually pretty spot on (thanks to you all!!!), but I cannot say one way or another how she would react to just that.  \nBut, we're hesitant right now. First, because we don't want it to come across that the way she gets DH to talk to her is by dumping 1k on him. Second, we don't want her to think she's auto-forgiven by dumping 1k on him. And third, we've got a lot of other shit on our plate to worry about right now (such as this virus stuff, my dad possibly relapsing from remission of his cancer, fostering way too many pets because we are helping out a friend in a rough situation (we have enough space and resources for everyone, even with having to occasionally separate our pets from the fosters. It's just a little tiring), etc.)  \nI just want to scream sometimes. Preferably at Fraaz. But I know that probably won't help anything.  \nWe want to hear from others' perspectives before we decide on how we want to handle this. Please give us your thoughts. \nETA: Just a small update. We read through all your comments last night and this morning. We sent all of the 1k back without a note. We have not heard anything from her yet. I'm not sure if she will actually say something about it or not. For now, depending on her reaction, we are thinking about giving her a short explanation and then telling her we need more time. If she doesn't say anything, neither will we. If she explodes, well then, there's not much more to say.\n\n"}, {"title": "My sorta just no mom proves she has no common sense, yet again  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "16", "comments": "2", "content": "Due to COVID-19, I've been working crazy hours.

But that one awful gift is a whole different post that made me glad for the lack. Anyway, I don't count as a mother in my family until she is dead, so nobody but her mattered.\nSo, she was always the one deciding what she wanted for dinner, and all of the gifts, and all of the attention if we did something formal.\nOne year she got a second dog. Now, both of her dogs are poorly trained and awful, and were always a point of conflict, but again, another post entirely. But to summarize, I expect dogs to have some degree of acceptable behavior, she does not, so she gets completely offended when you don't think that her dogs are just the greatest thing to ever live.\nSo, the next year, she called me earlier in the week and informed me that we would not be getting together for mother's day as had been planned. But that because it was the younger dog's birthday, we would be having a birthday party for the dog that day instead.\nYes, apparently the fact we bought an expensive dog she wanted from a breeder a year before, was a much more worthy reason to celebrate to her than the fact that she'd had three children.  \nBut it got better. \nShe informed me that I wasn't invited because I was mean to the dog (by expecting it to at least somewhat behave). But... That maybe if I was nice enough to the dog this week, the dog would allow me to come. I was then told the dog's preferences on treats and toys.\nAnd so that's how I noped out of mother's day with my mother, without the slightest bit of guilt, the last year before going no contact. Clearly I wouldn't want to put a damper on the dog's special day... obviously the dog is more important to her than I ever could be.\nIt's another of those stories that always helps me keep perspective when all of the people with decent mom's act shocked that I won't be contacting her.\n\n"}, {"title": "I\u2019m worried that my house isn\u2019t going to be my house.

Off the bat, his mom found a contractor to put laminate flooring in the house. Granted, we wanted to get laminate flooring and expressed that desire to her, but she just took charge and contacted the contractor on her own and sent him to the house to meet her (FIL had a key because he was doing some work we had asked him to do- don\u2019t worry, we will be getting the locks changed once we move in and she will NOT be having a key)\nI was seriously pissed off about this because neither me or my SO were consulted about this decision. SO is more chill with it, even though he thought it was odd, he looked at it more along the lines of \u201cwell this is good now this is one less thing we have to worry about\u201d and I agree it is one less thing to worry about... but I am so fking pissed off that we weren\u2019t consulted about this first! If she would have just asked I would have gladly agreed and been thankful. But her taking charge just makes it seem like this is her house and she can do whatever she wants. I know I\u2019m not crazy, and what she did is fucked up, but SO doesn\u2019t exactly see it that way. I love my fianc\u00e9 to death but he never sees the fault in people and everything is always peachy keen and no one means to do any harm, everyone has good intentions, including his family. There have been many issues with my MIL and me in the past and while he takes my side, he doesn\u2019t find her actions to be to purposely hurt me but rather she just has our \u201cbest interest at heart\u201d and I think that\u2019s fucking bullshit. \nAnyway, we went with the contractor because I just figured he was good and his prices were reasonable and it wouldn\u2019t make sense now to find a new contractor even though it ate me up inside to use the one she choose. So anyway, we got to pick our flooring and everything was fine. \nMy (usually) JYFIL is the only one in our family retired and off of work right now and he offered to paint the house for us. I was super excited about this because I was truly dreading having to paint the house because it\u2019s pretty big and most of the rooms were lime green and pink... so we emphatically agreed to this and he went to town applying the primer. We didn\u2019t hear anything back from him and just assumed he was still priming and that we would give him our paint samples when he was done. Then I find out, MIL told him to paint the house a generic white color WITHOUT ASKING US FIRST. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t start painting yet and I said hell no, here are our colors. So he started painting with our color and everything was fine... but it still ate at me that she tried to get her way AGAIN with the fucking paint color! SO agreed that was definitely rude of her but didn\u2019t confront her or anything. \nSo, the flooring is being installed this week and the painting is all done. We\u2019re excited about the move and everything but I feel kind of weird since I really didn\u2019t do much work on the house myself (my mom and I had plans to paint the house ourselves and while I absolutely appreciate my FIL doing the painting, it still made me feel a bit bad because I was looking forward to the bonding time with my mom but not the painting aspect itself lol) so I told my SO that me and my mom would be doing the deep cleaning on the house once the floors and everything has been finished. He told me oh no don\u2019t worry about it, MIL, SIL, and FIL said they\u2019ll deep clean for us. \nI just got so pissed! Like I want to do ONE thing for my house MYSELF on my OWN TERMS. I want to bond with my mom and clean with her and make memories in my first house. It really makes me mad and makes me feel like his whole family is just trying to take over everything on their own. Yes I know we\u2019re not married yet but I\u2019m raising his son in that house and we both consider it MY HOUSE as well. I want to clean MY HOUSE. So I tell SO that I want to clean and he said oh don\u2019t worry about it it\u2019s one less thing for us to worry about, let\u2019s take all the help we can get. And like yeah I get it, it might be hard to do the cleaning while caring for an infant BUT I WANT TO CLEAN MY OWN FUCKING HOUSE. So I texted FIL and told him not to worry about cleaning, my mom and I will be taking care of that. I haven\u2019t heard back from him yet, but I expect him to understand since he\u2019s normally a really cool guy and understanding. \nI just can\u2019t shake this feeling that they don\u2019t look at this house as \u201cmy house\u201d and that they see as their sons house only. Never mind the fact that we\u2019re engaged, I\u2019ll be living there, being a SAHM and raising their grandson in the house... I\u2019m really worried that this trend is going to continue because it always has. I don\u2019t want anyone else except my husband and me thinking that they can take control of MY HOUSE. I don\u2019t know how tell my fianc\u00e9 that what they\u2019re doing is wrong, because he only sees it as them helping us out, but I can see her true motives because she has proven to me time and time again that I am not as important as her son and has tried to control our relationship from the very beginning. I don\u2019t want this to continue. I can\u2019t be in constant fear that MIL will try to control my life and have an SO that doesn\u2019t understand the extent of her control. My SO is literally amazing in every single other aspect of our relationship, and I do not want to sacrifice our relationship because of this issue. I just don\u2019t know how to go about resolving this. I truly am beginning to hate my MIL and even become weary of my FIL, and I do not want to hold onto this hatred. I truly just want her to leave us the fuck alone.\n\n"}, {"title": "FMIL \u201cthinks\u201d it\u2019s okay to bring her dog into our house.

SO and I live in this cute little house with our three CATS. SO was having a small medical issue and asked FFIL for help with the problem. \nHe comes over and tries to help SO. Now SO has some temper problems and is quick to freak out and make things more complicated than they need to be.. sort of like his mother. While FFIL is talking to him, FMIL and their pit-mastiff mix are waiting in the car. Things are taking a while and she decided to come inside. Fine whatever, I\u2019m pretending to be asleep in the next room so I don\u2019t have to talk to them. Also, forgot to mention, SO is on the phone with the doctor about his problem.\nI hear FMIL call the dogs name and I instantly see red. Why in the actual fuck would you bring the pony size dog into our house. ((Side note, SO has a little dog. I don\u2019t like dogs, and SO\u2019s dog doesn\u2019t really like me. We keep our distance so everything\u2019s fine. But SO\u2019s dog really hates FMIL\u2019s dog. When I see FMIL\u2019s dog she loves to point out how I don\u2019t obsess and just love the stupid dog like everyone else. I tolerate it because I go to their house where I don\u2019t have say in things, but this is my house and SO\u2019s dogs house so why would you bring it here??? No one likes the untrained monster! Sorry, I\u2019m ranting.)) So I\u2019m laying in bed and I hear my cats running and the heavy breathing of the dog. One if not more of the cats runs over me into the window and I hear crashing noises as the dog runs into things knocking them over trying to get to a cat. One of the cats broke the curtains on the window above me causing it to fall. All of this happened so fast while SO was still on the phone with the doctor. \nI hear him say he\u2019ll have to call them back and then lots of yelling pursues. He asks her why she thought bringing the dog in was a good idea and she doesn\u2019t answer. She just herds the dog out and they leave. \nSO goes over to their house after all this and comes back to tell me FMIL has banned his dog from going to her house because she picks on her dog (the 15lb dog really terrorizes the 100lb dog in her mind since she turns away when her dog attacks SO\u2019s). They exchange some not nice words and he came back. \nThis is pretty much a rant and I little more anti-dog than I wanted it to be but how stupid and self centered to you have to be to think that cats will just instantly be okay with a dog 10x their size running into their house?? I just can\u2019t wrap my head around it, honestly.\n\n"}, {"title": "JNM, a nurse who treats Covid patients, thinks quarantine doesn't apply to her  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "258", "comments": "40", "content": "I'm boiling right now, and it feels like no one is taking me seriously. \nSo for background, my mom is an in-home nurse.

If you've never been to Niagara Falls on the US side, it's actually a pretty low income area. For my rich, white mom, who is exposed to Covid on a WEEKLY basis, to decide to jaunt on down to the slums so she can see the falls and the river just boggles my mind. \nAm I overreacting here?

I cook, I clean, and I take care of our child day in and day out already.\nI feel like she's getting competitive about cooking and cleaning? Idk, just the timing of when she decides to clean makes me think that way, usually right after she sees me cleaning. and she tries to take over or change things while I'm cooking. DH already asked her once not to mess with my cooking before because it bothered me. For example, the very next day, pancakes are easy right? She came right up beside me and turned the heat down when I already had it on low and was standing right there. Just small things that make me feel stupid for being upset about, but it's continuous. \nI feel like she thinks/acts like I'm not capable of doing things on my own or just wants to act like she does everything better? That's just a example, it never fails though. If I'm cooking, she's going to swoop in and try to \"fix\" things. These might be poor examples but honestly, I'm just so tired of dealing with it... And of course everytime I get upset, it's not a big deal. I don't want to feel like I'm in competition and I feel like the closer we get to the move out date the worse this is going to get...

You women are fucking killing it, as wive\u2019s and mom\u2019s dealing with craziness.  This is my first post and it will probably be all over the place, but here goes.\nMy mom was a very JN when I would see her.  Backstory: she gave custody of me to my grandmother when I was 2 and until I was 17 I was raised my my VJYGM.  I was \u201cspoiled\u201d but taught to respect what I was given.  She died in 2017 and it still hurts me to this day.  But here is where my story sets atm.  \nMy JNSO and I are divorcing and we have a 8 yo son, and A is very aware of what is going on and understands Dadddy is very controlling and I do what I want to keep A happy.  A is Autistic and very smart for his age, so he knows what\u2019s going on.\nWell JNSO hates that I don\u2019t do what he wants me to do and is very verbally not happy about it, and it has reached a breaking point of I just stare at him when he talks and don\u2019t respond.  (I swear Grey Rocking is amazing even when your divorcing!  Thanks for that tip all of you.)  JNSO has no idea what my plans are and I don\u2019t tell him if he asks.  So yay me.  Now back to my mom, B.\nA few years before VJYGM died, B was a VERY HARD JNMOM, more concerned with my brother and sister and I let it slide because I wasn\u2019t dealing with her brand of BS and was over it.  But on 22 Sept 2017 is when everything came to a head and she realized how bad she fucked me up.  See that was the day VJYGM was born and died.  And I shattered like glass.  We had a lot of words and none of them I can take back because it was true.  I went NC for a two years, and withdrew from the family to prove a point.  My JYSister agreed with me, and did the same thing.  \nEverything changed this past January when a lot of things happened.  I told JNSO that I wanted a divorce (a lot of shit happened in the summer and fall and I was overcooked emotionally.)  I should point out that my mom LOVES her grandkids.  All 8 of them.  So I picked up the phone and called her and just let everything out and didn\u2019t hide what was happening and she LISTENED, and was livid that SO was acting like this and told me that if I needed help to call her.  So we talk every few days and I can see some of  GM coming out in my mom.  She asks if I need anything and has been sending A money for college (in an account only I have access to.) and she sends me a little when she can.  (She stole over $6,000 my grandma set aside for me so when I decided to go to college, I had the money.)  I know it can\u2019t make up for what she did, but now she sees the damage it caused and is repairing the damage she did.\nI know that my story is rare, and I just wanted to share my story and I hope it make you smile a little.  My relationship with my JMMom is a work in progess but there is still time.  Good luck and I hope it gets better for all of you.  \nPS.  Smile.  It makes your butt shine.

I\u2019m new to Reddit. This is my first ever post! It\u2019s just going to be a long rant. I really don\u2019t talk to too many people (who care about listening to my problems anyway). My MIL is just verrrry overbearing. My husband and I got our own place and moved out in the beginning of March...thank god. But even still. Me and my husband are \u201cessential\u201d, so we are both still working. Our daughter (2 years old) will either go to the babysitter, or MIL will watch her while we are at work. Here are just a few of the things that are bothering me. First, a few weeks ago, her fathers building was on a complete lockdown because one of the residents who is on the same floor as him tested positive for covid. The resident got better, and full lockdown was lifted. So i\u2019m at work one day last week while she is watching my daughter, and i get a text \u201ccan i take baby to see pop, he hasn\u2019t left his building, so he doesn\u2019t have any germs?\u201d Well i\u2019m a huge pushover and have a hard time saying no. Especially when she is doing me a favor and watching the baby for free. She knows this. I just didn\u2019t answer her text and i texted my husband saying that she better not take the baby over there. But seriously, people are doing \u201cdrive by birthday parties\u201d, visiting their loved ones in nursing homes through windows, nobody is visiting anybody.. my parents haven\u2019t even seen my children since before this started. I also have a son who is 6 with a different guy. My son is with his dad during the week because his dad isn\u2019t working right now because of corona. So my son isn\u2019t an issue with her. Anyway, back on topic, like no. You\u2019re not taking my daughter to visit him, I\u2019m sorry. I really am, I know it would have made his day, and that breaks my heart. I don\u2019t care whether he has germs or not. But my daughter can have the germs and pass them to him. Then what if he gets sick from the visit!? Kids can be carriers of the virus without getting sick, then pass the virus to all their older sickly relatives when they go visit and hug them. This woman really needs to use her head. My husband did text her though and tell her that we don\u2019t want the baby anywhere but her house, our house, and the babysitters house. So they didn\u2019t go. Just my kids being out of my house at all worries me sick. Well that\u2019s the end of that story.. Next one is... I posted on my facebook that i wanted to trim my hair to get some practice in and maybe if i was good at it, i would trim my daughters bangs. She has the curliest hair, but her bangs are getting long and always in her eyes. I asked if anybody has any advice and MIL comments on it saying \u201cyeah, don\u2019t go near her hair, that\u2019s my advise.\u201d i ignored it because i had nothing nice to say at all after reading that.. then she writes back \u201cI had her sit on grandads lap the other day so he could hold her while i trimmed her bangs and she was not having it.. she moves around waaay too much.\u201d My daughter has never been to a professional to get a haircut before.. I\u2019ve been wanting to take her, but now i have to wait until this is over. Anyway, this lady is really taking it upon herself to cut my daughters hair and NOT EVEN TELL ME. She does all this shit while i\u2019m at work.. and it\u2019s not the first time she did it either. I went to put my daughters hair up in a high ponytail about a year ago and her bangs weren\u2019t staying up with it when they always have.. I was like wow, that\u2019s weird but i just brushed it off. A little while later, i see a tiny little picture frame on the counter with her blonde hair taped inside it!!!! I was heartbroken... she really just got her first haircut and i missed it!? And nobody could even tell me that it happened! She cut it while i was at work.. Maybe i\u2019m overreacting but, that\u2019s just not okay to me. I\u2019m her mother, those are MY decisions to make. I wanted to take her somewhere and make a big deal out of it, get one of those \u201cmy first haircut\u201d certificates, but she took that away from me and doesn\u2019t even respect me enough to tell me about it. Again, i MAY be overreacting to some of you... but to me, it\u2019s just very disrespectful. Back to the facebook post. I wrote back to her i don\u2019t remember the exact words but it was something like this \u201c please don\u2019t cut her hair again, i really want to be there whenever she gets a haircut. That\u2019s something that I don\u2019t want to miss... AGAIN\u201d She said nothing after that.. but I think I got my point across with that. I could go on alllll day and night about her, and the things she has done/said... like the one time she went thru my phone!! I left it unlocked on the table and left the room for a sec, i come back in and she\u2019s bent over the table scrolling through my texts. Just nutty shit. But i did get a lot off my chest. And I actually feel pretty good right now. She\u2019s not a bad person, I do like her (sometimes), she can be very helpful.. but i just think she needs to learn boundaries, and maybe some common sense too. I\u2019m not a very good writer, so sorry if i was all over the place. If you read this whole thing, then THANK YOU \ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\ude0a I appreciate any and all feedback as well.. whether it\u2019s about my writing and what i can do for it to be better next time, or any comments/advise on the MIL.

Easy since he used to work at the hospital and everyone there knows us and the situation with MIL. Well let me tell you, this woman let lose on me when I told her she did not need to come to the ER, he\u2019s only allowed one person in the room and I win. He was 32 at the time and we\u2019d been living together for a few years (and raising a kid). I made it very very clear to the hospital no information or visitors without my permission. Period. She literally tried everything to get information and get past the lobby. Our son still had baseball at the time so I told her she could visit as soon as I got back. Well I walk into the hospital lobby to see her & SIL (much younger 15ish) and a very annoyed looking Recepionist. She immediately started berating me because she could not go see her bbbaaaaabbbyyy. Ugh. Granted we have a whole other host of issues that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be posting about in this forum very soon but when she started yelling at me I lost my cool. I literally put my hand in her face and told her to stop. I reminded her that her son is a grown adult with a family and does not need his mother anymore. One of the biggest reasons I was not allowing her to visit as he did not want to see her alone because they have a lot of their own problems. She\u2019s only good at two things, being the center of attention or being the victim. I already knew from social media she was trying to gain sympathy about her poor baby being in the hospital and of course passing a lot of incorrect information along. The second she started yelling at me again I yelled over her \u201c if you\u2019re not feeding him, financing him or fucking him he is no longer your problem. He\u2019s my problem now and you could either play by my rules are you can get the fuck out I really don\u2019t care which\u201d. Luckily that shut her up but we only made it about a half an hour into her visit before she sent his blood pressure through the roof and he asked me to get her to leave.

I also think I\u2019m going to need a name for her - I\u2019m open to suggestions. \nAs a reminder, DH works away at the moment and I am in self-isolation 27 weeks pregnant and I only see him every second weekend. \nBecause DH works away, and I\u2019m nervous with this pregnancy, he sleeps with his phone ringer on in case something happens and I need to call him in the middle of the night. \nWednesday at 130am he wakes up to his phone beeping repeatedly and at first panic he thought it was me. His mom is texting him, pleading with him to believe her, he HAS to watch this one video before morning because the world is ending tonight and they NEED to say their goodbyes. She directs him to look at the video in messenger. He didn\u2019t respond to her, but he did check messenger and there was nothing from her. It didn\u2019t come through until 8:30 that morning, he couldn\u2019t figure out the delay, but I did instantly. She had to have forgotten she blocked him on there and probably couldn\u2019t figure out why it wasn\u2019t going through. He asked if I had received anything from her, but thanks to you kind reddit people, you showed me how I could block her while I am blocked and I did just that. \nSo my bet of her waiting until July (due date) to unblock was wrong, but I believe after she sent the messages in messenger she blocked him again...but yet not blocking him for text messages. What\u2019s the point?! Especially if she\u2019s going to reach out via text? He only downloaded the messenger app because she asked him to as it was free for her - he doesn\u2019t use it to talk to anyone else. \nHe fills me in later on in the day about all this. At this point, I\u2019m struggling to have patience with this woman and I know I\u2019m getting snarky because I honestly just don\u2019t know how to handle this anymore. I asked what exactly he believes she thinks is happening - how does the world just \u2018end\u2019? His response: \u201cBabe, she thinks its Ragnarock\u201d. Ah - finally something I can somewhat understand (I\u2019m Norwegian, huge Thor fan my entire life).  He\u2019s concerned because he knows she\u2019s been this unstable his entire life but as an adult he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s ever seen her this wrapped up in a conspiracy (and that\u2019s saying something - in the 80\u2019s she was convinced CSIS and CIA had tapped their phones and were listening in on conversations so she would create codes to talk in or walk to pay phones. I\u2019ve often wondered if she has Schizophrenia-induced paranoia). I asked if he wanted to call in a wellness check and he said kind of but at the same time, she isn\u2019t threatening to harm herself. We also have no idea where she lives (she couch surfs a lot until she\u2019s kicked out, sometimes she lives in her camper van, etc.) and the city she lives in is a major Canadian city. And he\u2019s concerned about what she would do if she found out it was him that called it in, after seeing how she put our infertility info on facebook, AND all the posts calling out \u201cthe rat\u201d who was reporting her fake news posts (It\u2019s me - I\u2019m the rat, she doesn\u2019t know). And I flat out said - who cares? DH NEVER goes on his facebook, EVER. Before his mother blocked me, I monitored every post she made, and most were met with comments from her friends calling her out on fake news and she would lose her mind on those people and tear them apart. I did it a couple times, but she never once responded to me (I\u2019d always comment politely with proper facts and links, or even telling her to actually read the post she just shared because it\u2019s FOUR YEARS OLD and not current news). I told him it was very obvious that most of her friends list see her for who she truly is and how she truly acts. And the wellness check would be out of love, not a malicious attempt to shut her up (though I know she wouldn\u2019t see it that way). \nWednesday night when we were saying good night, I jokingly said \u201cWell, see you in Valhalla!\u201d That got me a huge eye roll. And Thursday morning when I woke up I messaged him and said \u201cwell I guess I\u2019m still on Midguard for another day with the peasants - what about you?\u201d. Like I said, I was getting tired and snarky that this woman can\u2019t see through her own fake news and she has nothing to say for herself when the world continues to NOT END. It\u2019s merely delayed. \nThen DH said something that concerned me on a new level - this is obviously a \u201ccult\u201d following. When DH was 5-6 years old, his mother moved him and her to a new country to specifically JOIN A CULT. It lasted about a year. I asked him if she would do this again and he admitted he was surprised she hadn\u2019t already. So then I spent half the night laying in bed wondering if this poor (both in the literal and emotional sense) woman is being taken advantage of. She\u2019s very vulnerable and I can\u2019t help but wonder who is turning the keys on her end to get her so worked up. Can it really be just the news? I had my cousin look up her profile (it\u2019s open) and the day she blocked us there were about 50 posts she said. All various conspiracies and random comments and bible versus. It almost feels like someone is \u201cpushing\u201d information out there to individuals such as herself. And just like that, I felt bad for being snarky and joking about her beliefs because she is obviously very troubled by them. \nMy mom\u2019s friend had a meme on facebook and it said \u201cI don\u2019t go crazy. I AM crazy. I just go normal from time to time\u201d. And that really hit me hard. His mom isn\u2019t stable, she\u2019s unstable and becomes stable sometimes. DH agreed she\u2019s been more unstable than stable his entire life. It was as if a lightbulb went off in my head. She\u2019s not stable with periods of instability, she\u2019s consistently unstable, with small periods of stability. Seeing it that way has really opened my eyes and has helped in accepting we will never have a \u201cnormal\u201d relationship with her. We can try to enjoy her small periods of stability and take advantage of knowing her in that state, but when she\u2019s unstable unfortunately we have to distance ourselves. Does that make sense? To me, it makes it easier to assume the worst but hope for the best. For me mentally it just makes it that little bit easier to assume she\u2019s in her unstable period all the time. And I still plan to uphold boundaries and not let her around our child when she\u2019s in her instability periods and I still plan on holding her accountable for her actions. I guess the past few days just made it all make more sense and that little bit easier for me to let go, not feel guilty and to stay emotionally uninvolved. She can be a very draining woman. \nSorry - this kind of turned into a rant/venting session but I just had to get this off my chest. DH is actually able to come home this weekend so it will be interesting to see if she\u2019s still pushing her conspiracy videos. She refuses to talk about anything else at this point.\n\n"}, {"title": "My MIL probably thinks I\u2019m a witch and I\u2019m tempted to just let her believe it.

I know he hears it as well because he gets this look on his face when he hears her voice. We go on for a few minutes before he asks for his song, and before I have a chance to react I hear her screaming that I meed to get off my ass, stop babying the r***rd and bring her a trash bag.\nY'all... This is the sweetest kid I know, and the look on his face when he heard this bloated beached whale call him retarded had me seeing red.

I held it together long enough to sing him his song and spoke to his mom for a minute before I hauled myself out of bed and let me tell you that going off on her felt fantastic. I threw everything on the table from her hijacking our wedding to the state of the house after I spent 19 days in the hospital and everything in between. I just it all out and then promptly turned to my husband and said this was also on him for letting her get away with acting like a spoiled brat for so long.\nI packed up some stuff and all my valuables, called my closest friend and am currently in her guest house with 5 kittens fighting over who gets to lay in my lap and a mama cat who seems happy for a break laying on a chair next to the bed.\nI don't know if I'll be going back, other than to get the rest of my stuff. I can handle a lot, but that was just too damn far in my book.\nUPDATE: First of all, WOW! The response to this was overwhelming. \nI've spoken with my husband and he agrees that for the time being, staying at my friends is best for me. He has contacted our lawyer and will be coming over with some options later.

But she knows I was fucking right and has an metric ass ton of shit to fix with me.\nA lot has happened in the family from when I dropped the rope.\n\nsome of my other cousins (three of them specifically) that absolutely hate the uncle too broke their NC with him and too call him out on his behavior: if guessed that this didn\u2019t go well... you\u2019d be right \n\nCousin A : It would be an understatement to say he went berserk and tried to physically assault my cousin A, in front of her husband. Her husband who\u2019s a police officer for their city, her husband who also happened to be wearing his body cam because he just had a \u201cfeeling\u201d shit would go down. They shared the video with us in case any of the cousins were feeling weak at the \u201ccancer\u201d card everyone keeps playing. At first all you hear is my cousin politely airing her grievances and being honest that she doesn\u2019t trust him and doesn\u2019t want to bring her kids around him based on his history and how traumatizing and terrifying it was for her - she didn\u2019t even finish talking before he starts verbally berating her and calling her horrible names - \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve changed, we\u2019re leaving\u201d is all she said in the quietest and calmest voice; and he flipped the table and went for the throat with one hand and fist in the other!! And then it was garbled and theres yelling from her husband for her to call the cops now, he\u2019s got uncle pinned and I think either a foot or knee on his neck (either way uncle is on the ground cursing and screaming that he\u2019ll kill cousin and cousins husband). \ncousin B and cousin C : they went together, neither of them wanted to bring their wives to meet the uncle; and after seeing how cousin A was attacked they didn\u2019t want to risk anything happening. They went to go check on my aunt (uncles wife) because you only catch a glimpse of her in the body cam video and something just looked wrong to them. [back story, when we were younger my aunt was absolutely gorgeous, like she had the adorable librarian with the big glasses feel and the softest most marshmallow personality, how she ever got stuck with uncle is a mystery]. They don\u2019t have body cams so this is just paraphrasing what they said, but they said that seeing her was absolutely soul shatteringly heart breaking, and these are guys that don\u2019t use words like this btw! She looks like a walking corpse; malnourished, bruises (fresh bruises), she had a glass thrown at her face and it shattered so now one of her eyes don\u2019t work and she has an eye patch over it, limping. They took a picture and part of me wishes I could post it, just to show what horror that poor woman has gone through and why I HATE that man so much. They said the entire time uncle kept talking about how nothing good has ever happened in his life, and how he needs money for his \u201ccancer\u201d. Cousin B asked when he got diagnosed; uncles response he didn\u2019t he just has all the symptoms from what google said and he\u2019s trying to collect the money before he goes to the doctor. Cousin C asked him how much he\u2019s saved from the rest of the family donating to him, he got defensive and said he didn\u2019t have much left because he needed to pay bills and his \u201cworthless wife is too ugly to work now\u201d. And that\u2019s when My cousin B asked if she wanted to leave, they offered her a place to stay; and she declined. Uncle got pissssssed, and he tried physically assault cousin B. Now a lot of us as we got older and away from our parents took self defense, married people that could protect us, and/or became people that could protect against him; that\u2019s how much he terrified us). Cousin C tased him, a lot. And then called the cops.\nSo yeah; uncle hasn\u2019t changed Still excessively violent and hateful, cancer is not confirmed, and my aunt is still stuck there by her own design.\nNow when my mom contacted me this morning through Skype because I forgot to block her in there, we had a very serious conversation. I sent her the video and told her about cousins B and Cs visits, and she had no words. \nI asked her honestly Why she hates my kids to the point she would want them to be potentially abused by such an evil man. When she brought out of the family card, I told her family doesn\u2019t hurt family, and if that\u2019s all she\u2019s got I\u2019ll block her again.\nI asked her if she\u2019s seen aunt recently and she said no, so I sent her the photo of when I was 15 with aunt (the last time I ever saw her) and then sent her the recent photo cousin B sent me. I showed her the horror one man inflicted on her. And I asked her again does family have a right to do that? And she broke down and cried, and I honestly had no sympathy. This is when I went a little psycho and just unleashed on her that she was a horrible mom when it came to anything that had to do with her family, she left us to the wolves and NEVER protect us against the horrors. She may have been a good mom with other things, but she failed where she was needed the most. \nIt was a lot of tears for both of us, she had no justification for his behavior once you take the family aspect out of it, and she apologized and begged me to unblock her and that she\u2019d never push again, and missed the boys. \nBut I can\u2019t forgive her and I told her that; also told her she broke my heart when she picked an abusive POS that she can\u2019t even stomach to be around herself, she broke my trust and she has to earn that back as well as my respect.\nMaybe I\u2019m the justno here but I told her if she ever wants to be in my life again or see the kids;\n1) she has to block him, she needs to 100000% cut him out of her life\n2) she needs to start going to therapy to fix the family mentality that is ingrained into her (I might go with her)\n3) she has to apologize and admit she was wrong to all the cousins she tried to force to go see him\n4) she needs to get the other aunts and uncles to fuck off about seeing him\n5) she has to take back telling everyone I was possessed by a demon and tell them the REAL reason I cut her out. \nI told her I don\u2019t care what order these are done in, but they need to be done before I even consider her my mother again.\nEdit to add: we\u2019ve tried getting my aunt away from him before. We called the police, APS, all the domestic abuse resources in our state, the cousins have physically tried to help get her away, but she refuses to leave him and denies all allegations with the authorities are involved. The rare instance she was removed by the authorities, she ran right back to him when she was free.\nEdit 2: \nhe\u2019s in jail right now for trying to assault cousin b and c while on bail for trying to assault cousin a. Aunt is still at the house because SHE WONT FUCKING LEAVE THE HOUSE. And has said herself she doesn\u2019t want to leave and is going to wait for him. We\u2019re getting APS involved to try to get her help\n\n"}, {"title": "The War Is Over  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "846", "comments": "47", "content": "I had to delete my last post.  There was a breach of one of my online profiles.  Turns out it was the book of faces but had to do some damage control before I knew.\nMy JNM earned her name and will henceforth be known as Plague Granny.\nIn my last post I ranted about how she went up to my sister's place in another city despite my province's prohibition on unnecessary travel.  She knew I was off work for two weeks because of her travel.  Well, I fucked myself over.  I made a post on FB that was calling out people like her.  In a comment I called her something I had only previously called her in my head.  My FB is private and not searchable to non-friends and everything is set to private/friends only.  My mother and sister are not on my friends list.  But somehow they got ahold of the post.  I've only traced it back to one of my sister's RL friends who is not a friend of mine either.  So basically PG went nuclear up at my sister's.\nWhen she got home the next week she gave me a deadline to be out of \"her\" house.  She gave me until May 1 to move.  So for the next couple weeks I searched for a place in the town I work in.  I also started applying for jobs with other firms.  I did find a place in the town I work in that would have required a raise to afford (still the cheapest place I could find).  I asked my boss for a raise (haven't had once since I started 3 years ago despite upgrading my education - 1/2 way to my CPA designation now).  He hemmed and hawed but agreed to a $4000 raise that would be revocable if he didn't think I earned it.\nWell, last week I had an interview in the city I live in.  I got an email offer on Monday which would include a $9000 raise.  I've always been afraid of change when it comes to giving up my known situations even if they are uncomfortable.  But I decided to check out a place in town.  If it wasn't going to work I'd take the shithole near the current job and the shitty raise.\nBut, MY GOD, this place was incredible.  New construction, all utilities including cable and internet included.  Walk out basement suite with 1 bed/bath + den, 1200 sq.ft.  Only $300 more than the shit hole where I would have a tiny bedroom/bathroom and grudging access to the common kitchen (which she wasn't apparently going to let me access originally).  \nSo of course I took the job and the apartment!  \nThe only catch is that the apartment is not going to be ready until May 30th and the job starts June 15th.\nDad, who until now has stayed out of this last spat, was able to negotiate the move out deadline until June 1.\nSo in 4 weeks, I will be out!  As soon as I made the decision it was like all my stress was steam being released out of a pressure cooker.  I haven't felt this good mentally in years!\nPS:  Apparently I was not the only person who called the tip line/cops on PG being out visiting.  One of my sister's neighbors must not have appreciated seeing a non-resident vehicle coming and going.   Because PG got a call from the RCMP about her travels.  Somehow, one of the towns she works in also found out.  They called her and told her not to bother with her usual weekly trip.  So that would have contributed her pissiness on top of my post.\nPPS:  She made a third trip to my sister's and I am currently wondering why she hasn't gone again since she's on such minimal hours.\n\n"}, {"title": "Got told my parenting skills will be overridden since this will be my first child and she knows how to raise children better?

I didnt know where else to post this for advice.\nI'm a little over 3 months pregnant with my first child. My grandmother basically raised me and the oldest of my two little brothers. Since I've made the announcement, her behavior has gotten absolutely ridiculous.\nFirst incident: When I announced the pregnancy to her, she asked me to take her off speaker phone (as my father, brother, and FDH were all in the room anxiously waiting for her reaction) and proceeded to make me cry by being so horrible. She told me to not get it in my head that she is excited because she was very upset and disappointed that I had decided to ruin my life by having a child and that I will now be permanently tied to my FDH. HER PLANS for me were for me to re-enlist in the national guard (She pressured me into enlisting at 17. Worst mistake of my life. I loved the guard and the people in it, but she and everyone now hold that over my head) and for me to find a nice christian man (not FDH) to settle down with around my thirties to then have children with. Hours after this happened, she asked if she could tell her two friends so they could gossip about how my life is now over. I went home and cried myself to sleep that night.\nSecond incident: a name I liked for a girl was Morticia Rose. Im a HUGE Addams Family fan. She yelled at me for having it written in my book as a suggestion and said \"If you ever named your baby gurl that, I will only call her Mortie just because you had the audacity to give her such a terrible name. I would never let you forget that.\" And then made fun of the boys names i had written down.\nThird incident: I have BARELY started showing yet, I honestly look like I just had a good lunch. I wear really baggy clothes anyways, so you can't see my stomach no matter what I wear. She always rubs my belly (and I have a little bit of fat) and says \"rub the baby!\" And does it repeatedly when i smack her hand away because it makes me uncomfortable, she never asks permission, she didnt put it there, and I'm not even showing at all. Its not like you can feel the baby. She gets offended when I tell her to stop because \"she raised me and has every right to rub my belly and do whatever she wants\"\nFourth incident: She says I have no parenting skills and that shes going to end up raising another child, she tells this to everyone. I was the only one out of four kids she raised that came out semi okay because I spent every waking moment with my Great grandfather and not her. She has told me that she will dress and teach my child how she feels like because her parenting skills are much better than mine will be because a life with FDH and I will be \"evil and demon filled\" because we listen to rock music and like horror movies. I even caught her talking to her mother on the phone saying how once they force me to take all the left over junk that they claim is mine (but isn't) then they'll just have to take my baby and raise it because i wont have the room for anything the baby needs.\nI could keep going, but I would be going on for DAYS. Is this me being pregnant and hormonal? Shes never acted this way about a child or towards me. Is this normal? What should I do?

She is constantly being compared to her cousin (10 months) and isn't worth their time. \nI took my daughter's to my BIL house  because the family was going shooting and the kids were going to play together. My husband stayed back to work on the yard. From the minute I walked in, she started criticizing my LO (7 months old). \nShe was cranky so I said she didn't feel good. MIL - \"That's not an excuse when she's always like that\"\nShe cried when her cousin head butted her. MIL - \"She clearly has issues being around other kids\"\nShe didn't smile when MIL got in her face MIL - \"She doesn't know how to laugh or smile\"\nIt went on like this for 2 hours with other family members chiming in. \"Cousin does nothing but smile but LO doesn't know how!\" \"You guys claim she smiles and laughs but you must drug her when you leave the house because she has 0 personality\" \"Aren't you concerned she isn't entertaining?\" \"Look how perfect cousin is unlike LO\" \nNo one engaged her more than once. When they tried to play with her and she didn't instantly laugh, they scoffed at her and said \"you're too serious/no fun\". MIL held her for a few minutes and then claimed it hurt her back to hold her. She then picked up cousin and was just fine holding him. When I was holding her and she started bouncing and getting happy, they all ignored her. When she started to fuss, MIL had to comment about \"how LO just doesn't know how to be happy\"  \nEventually, I said we needed to get home and left. I couldn't hear it anymore. I'm sorry my 7 month old doesn't entertain you. Maybe she just doesn't like you. (I regret not saying it)\nAnd I get that a baby having 0 interaction IS concerning. But my daughter is SO happy and smiley at home and day care. She laughs all the time. She chatters away and tries to copy what her sister does.  She loves to play. When we are out somewhere, she quiets down and watches everything. \nCompared to some stories on here, I don't know if she's a true JNMIL because she does help us out a lot and loves everyone. My husband tells me \"this is just how his family is\". I just don't know if I can continue to bring my kids around people that are so negative.\nEDIT: I want to address a lot I've been told/asked \n1) After each issue I mentioned, I put contact on hold with his family and my husband essentially told them to knock it off.  They are better for  awhile and then something happens again. Once I left, I told my husband it would be a long time before we saw them again. \n2) I was abused as a child. When I am in these situations, I shut down completely. Yes I want to protect my children. I hate myself for putting them in the position. Once they start getting into saying things, I cannot move or speak. It reduces me back to a fearful child who is unable to get away for fear of what would happen. I know it is an issue. I am in therapy and work really hard. Yes there is something wrong with me as some have asked and I'm working through it. I hate myself each time for letting my children around it but then am too terrified to get away. I'm trying really hard but I don't always get it right.\n\n"}, {"title": "JNFIL died - mixed feelings  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "372", "comments": "24", "content": "My FIL died last week - he was in his late 80's.  We have been NC with JNMIL, JNFIL and JNSIL (THE GC)\n for a few years at this point, but I have known them for more than 20 years.  DH and I have kids that are teens. \nAfter decades of problems, a few years ago they did and said unforgivable things to us when my son was critically ill.  We just couldn't take it anymore and decided we were done.\nLast week SIL called and left a message for DH that FIL had died.  DH was mostly just relieved.  The kids were ok with it.  I was sad, most upset than I thought I would be.   Not that I missed him the person, but what it had come to.  I also mourn what he wasn't and all the strife he caused us.  \nFor a brief time I thought DH should return SIL's call.\nFast forward to today when we saw the obituary.   DH is listed, my kids are listed. Every spouse of every surviving relative is listed except for me.  Even the third wife of one of the FIL's dead brothers is listed (lovely woman, but their marriage was only 3 years total).  \nI've been with DH for 26 years.  I am the mother of the only grandkids.   This confirms more than ever that they see me as the problem, and only the incubator they tolerate.  I'm sure they blame the NC on me, despite that it was me that kept it from happening earlier.   In their twisted mind my kids are really more JNSIL's kids since they share the same \"blood\".  (never mind half their DNA is from me.)\nThese are the people who called me a bad mother for following doctors orders regarding my child who needed a bone marrow transplant to survive and not having JNSIL be the bone marrow donor (the Dr.'s didn't even want her tested).   I wanted to barf when I saw \"devoted grandfather\" listed in the obit.  This is a guy who couldn't even call his grandson when he spent dozens of days in he hospital. \nJNMIL and JNSIL are grade-A delusional bitches.  I hate them and I am so glad we never called them back last week.  \nThis is more a vent than anything.  I wish I could really be free of them and the pain they cause.   It bothers me that this bothers me.  Thanks for listening, I feel like you all are the only ones that would get it.

(self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "317", "comments": "59", "content": "I'm not going to be marking this as a success today or any time soon because DH and I are just starting the marriage counseling, but after our first week and our first meeting over the weekend, we both feel like we'll be able to make some progress as long as we both stay open and respect each other's feelings. I'm not sure how we'll be able to gauge progress with Wreck-It Rose and her bullshit though, because, you know, not seeing her. (Although not having to deal with her next weekend for Mother's Day is definitely a score!)\nSo we both sat down with our counselor for the first time via video chat. It was only an initial meeting, but at the end of the meeting, after hearing both sides of our issue (our issue being WIR), she said it sounds like WIR is \"strong-willed\" and \"overbearing.\" She did ask me if I felt like I was maybe a little hypersensitive to WIR and if I was letting my mind make her every move into a personal attack. I told her absolutely. I said that when I first started feeling like WIR was trying to cause problems, I tried to accommodate her and let things roll off my back, but then when I was being nitpicked for everything down to how I sat on the couch and none of my concerns about her were even addressed, then her boundary stomping and trying to take over aspects of my life and her starting fights over our wedding pictures and the whole thing with her never being able to take \"no\" for an answer and either pushing us until we change our minds or plowing forward as if we said yes, I felt like years of what I feel to be abuse from her have reverberated into even the most microscopic level. I said that, while DH has admittedly made a lot of progress as far as boundaries and changing their dynamic on his end, the years of having to sit quietly and take her abuse while not having my own needs heard, make me feel like I need to let loose about EVERYTHING she does that bothers me so that SOMETHING will stick. The therapist gave us some homework, which was for me to breathe slowly and relax my body when WIR is brought up in conversation because \"a calm body cannot harbor anxiety,\" and after our call, I asked DH how his conversation with WIR earlier in the morning went. He told me about some of what they talked about, fully knowing that I was trying to use the opportunity to practice my homework. Plus, it gave me an opportunity to hear about the things going on in his family, namely the family members of his I love (which is almost all of them) and JNSIL, who has been making lots of bad decisions in the face of the state of the world right now.\nDH will be getting a homework assignment of his own next week (she's starting us off slowly, which I appreciate), and we were given a group assignment as well. The assignment is: we each write a letter outlining our ideal future that includes WIR. I don't want DH to have to cut off his mother (that is until she does something extreme, like threatening me or one of our future kids or something like that, but I'd like to get him to a point where he can handle her himself and will make that decision himself if--god forbid--things come to that) but I also want her in my life as little as possible. If I was writing this six months ago, maybe I would feel differently, but I still have not heard a single word from her regarding me losing two family members in a car accident four months ago, and that was the final straw for me. If you can't even say to your son who is standing right next to you and who is currently texting his wife about her dead family members, \"Tell her I'm sorry for her loss,\" then that wife doesn't owe you a relationship.\nSo far, I'm thinking my letter should say that DH can have whatever relationship he wants with her as long as he stands up for me when she starts her bullshit, he shuts her down when she refuses to take no for an answer and will instill consequences if she plows through of causes damage to someone somehow (I.e., pretending like hearing about my losses was a tabloid headline she doesn't care about), and sets boundaries of his own, such as telling her to mind her own business when she gets nosy about things in his life and telling her somehow to fuck off when she makes fun of him or chastises him for the decisions he makes for us or himself. I'm still working on the part of the letter addressing my future relationship with WIR, but I'm feeling a lot of \"my house, my kids, my marriage, my rules, and your opinion is not wanted\" with a little bit of \"if my rules or boundaries are pushed or stomped, she get consequences and has to apologize and adjust her behavior.\" I feel like after the aforementioned ignored loss, whatever positive relationship WIR and I could have had is a fantasy that will never be realized. She told me and DH loud and clear how little fucks she has to give about me, and I have absolutely no willpower left in me to have a relationship with her. It's not vindictive, it's not petty, it's not hatred. I just don't have the capacity to try to make a relationship with someone who has hit me over the head with a sledgehammer that says \"I wouldn't even give you kindness if your family died.\" I'll be civil with her as long as she's civil with me, and that's about all I can muster.\nI'm marking this as NAW because I want to write my letter with as little outside input as possible. This is all about what I want in my specific relationship with WIR and DH. However, if anyone had a similar assignment from a therapist, whether it was about their MIL/Mom or someone else, I'd like to hear your stories and how things went with it.\nI also wanted to add that DH really likes our therapist and feels like things will go well with her. That's a HUGE plus, since, thanks to WIR, he's incredibly closed off and doesn't let a lot of people in. And the fact she isn't telling me I need to get over it because FaMiLy and is helping me to address my stress levels first, it feels amazing and for the first time I really feel heard in my cries for help about WIR.\nEdited to add: I'm getting a few comments saying that the therapist giving me an exercise to deal with WIR being brought up in conversation is her telling me that I need to just get over my feelings or repress them, and that I'm not overreacting to WIR and her antics. I'd like to address these.\nFirst, before we had our meeting with the therapist, we were asked to use the chat function of the website to express our feelings on why we were in therapy. DH made a post after I did, and he included some goals for therapy. I made another post that included my goals, one of which was to be able to slowly get better at handling my emotions about WIR. I want to be able to hear her name or have a conversation about her without immediately having my hair stand on end and my body tense up. I feel like my physical and mental health will benefit greatly if I can relax and not give her the power of getting under my skin just at the mention of her name. I asked for this. This is not the therapist repressing my feelings. This is her helping me to achieve my goals for multiple aspects of my own health.\nSecond, I was never accused of overreacting. She asked me if I was a little hypersensitive. As far as either of us understood, she did not say I was overreacting, but was pointing out--and I agreed with her totally--that I react too often, and that I take everything as a planned attack and not what a lot of it most likely is, which is her plowing through and not caring how we are effected by her actions. I told the therapist that I absolutely feel like I'm hypersensitive to WIR, and I told her that I feel like I've been WIR's punching bag for so many years without feeling like I can rely on DH to stop her. I told her I feel like my reaction to suppressing my abuse seemed normal as far as victims of this kind of abuse go, and she seems to agree. The therapist said WIR sounded incredibly overbearing and self-centered with not much empathy, and that this kind of relationship is toxic (I was so glad to hear her use \"toxic\" to describe this behavior!). Her goal is to loosen WIR's grip on us and help us work together to have a healthy relationship with each other and as healthy of one that we can get out of WIR. Since we can't change her, that will revolve around our reactions to her.\nAnd to the person who said that DH \"just needs to be a good husband,\" that is literally the goal here, but it needs to be worked towards. You saying that was not helpful.\nEdited to add some detail.\n\n"}, {"title": "MIL-to-be is now banned from my home, chaos ensues.

This arrangement is agreeable with both of us for the time being, but because of the health crisis she is currently staying at my house.\nOur state is currently doing a soft-reopen. This prompted my GF's mother to ask to have dinner with her. She explained that she is at my house and we would like to continue to social distance. As usual, she made her feel guilty and insisted on seeing her. After talking about it, a deal was arranged. Since my GF's mother and father are in good health, they can come over for dinner under the condition that they keep things polite and leave promptly no later than 9pm. In exchange, I'll cook us all a nice meal and remain polite as well. We all agree to those terms.\n7pm rolls around. I have a nice meal ready for us four. The doorbell rings. Only problem, it isn't her mom and dad. It's some of her extended family. 4 of them. My girlfriend's cousin, his wife, and their two kids. The kids start running around my house. I'm not a kid person. Her cousin says that GF's mom invited them. Shit. I plan to show them out very soon but it was pouring rain and at the time I was still making an effort to be polite.\nDoorbell rings again, two more vague relatives at the door. I feel like that scene in the Hobbit where more and more people keep coming through the door, wanting to eat all my food. I'm waiting for GF's parents to show up so I can throw them all out in unison. Parents arrive shortly after and we have a chat. Not only did they violate the simple rules I had in my own house, but this is completely unsafe. There is still a pandemic!\nI must have lost track of the kids because I hear one crying like she'd been hurt. When we get to them it was clear they had been in a room they weren't supposed to go in. To clarify, me and my girlfriend are very kinky. I have a small room in my house dedicated to storage of our adult items. The little boy had taken a whip from a low-sitting cubbie and hit his sister with it.\nNot only was half of my GF's family seeing a very private area of my home, but since they hadn't had the brains to watch their kids, now they've come in contact with a space that kids should under no circumstances be exposed to. Upon seeing the room, my GF's mother gasps and makes a comment about how \"this is the road that lesbianism leads you down\". That was it, I saw red. I said that what I do in my home is my goddamn business. I also told her how disrespectful it was to bring uninvited guests to someone's home. Therefore, she will never be getting an invite again. I shoo them all out.\nMy GF isn't talking very much, I think she's embarrassed over today's events which I completely understand. We had a short conversation, she told me that I was so mean to everyone and I could have accommodated them. I told her that her mom broke the agreement, not me. Her mother is now blowing her phone up, thinking she's in a sex cult. I'm not sure where I stand in all of this, I could have been nicer but lines were crossed today.\n\u200b\nUPDATE: This situation happened 2 days ago. Me and my GF have had a more in depth discussion since then, but she still insists that I was the rude one. Her mother is profusely trying to call me, and is still constantly texting her daughter. She has come to the conclusion that the room she saw was some kind of torture chamber and that her daughter is in an abusive relationship. Naturally, I am the villain. She is demanding that her daughter text her regularly or she will contact the police about a possible domestic abuse going on in the house. This seems like some kind of blackmail. We're at the point where I've gotten my GF to agree that her mom was rude and lacking etiquette, but she thinks I am guilty of the same thing.\nI love my GF dearly but this whole situation is not it. I come from a dysfunctional abusive family and this gives me similar vibes. I've advised my GF to text her mother one last time that she is fine and just block her for a while, she won't do it. I've also been getting bipolar messages from MIL saying things ranging from \"I'll pray for you\" to \"what have you done to my daughter?? I WILL CONTACT THE AUTHORITIES!!!\". I am at a loss. I'm working from home with clients and it's incredibly distracting to see those messages pop up. GF has been tearful and has been resisting my efforts to comfort her. According to AmITheAsshole I am apparently not the asshole, but it sure feels like it at home. Any advice? I'll be checking reddit throughout the day so I can answer additional questions if you have them.\n\u200b\nUPDATE 2: I have shown GF a lot of the comments so far. She was upset but has finally admitted that her mother was very controlling in her childhood and this has been a long time coming. She's apologized for not having my back and turning the whole situation on me. We've agreed to do online couples counselling and she will also be doing individual counselling. Some of your comments really shook her up (in a good way) and it's becoming clear to the both of us that this was most likely a power move on the part of FMIL. GF is still unconvinced that her mother didn't have good intentions but she at least admits that this is something she's done before, especially in situations she isn't in control of. I am GF's first female partner and FMIL isn't too pleased about that. I haven't been able to convince GF to block her mother, but she is no longer responding to her. If the police come, we will show them the messages and the 47 missed calls on my phone. We are both going to sit down tonight and discuss new and firmer rules when it comes to FMIL. I have stood firm on FMIL's perma-ban. Any new rule suggestions would be appreciated.\n\n"}, {"title": "last bit of hope before I leave the man I was planning on spending my life with...

I didn't really want to go but since I had agreed on visiting FFIL (they're divorced) I had to oblige and go see her as well. Cue to the same old comments about my weight (with a bonus from FDH who gave the \"shut-up-or-we're-leaving look) and an incredible persistence in trying to get our address - that she OBVIOUSLY didn't get. I had to go to the point of telling her it's my parents home so I am not authorized to give the address away without their consent. She tried asking again a few days later but has given up.\nShe also tried to peer into our life plans such as, what I'll be doing next year, pressuring me to get a job (I have one and I'm still in college), wanting to know about KIDS (FDH and me have been dating for a YEAR) and so and so. She tried to pass as this benevolent old soul who's trying to give us youngsters precious life advice but I know she's only trying to manipulate us and get as much info as possible.\nHaven't seen her since Christmas and besides the ocasional call she had with FDH she hasn't contacted us with her shennanigans.

Towards the end of the night a family member of my husband's starts asking me about my education and what I was studying. So we had a really good conversation about that and she wishes me the best of luck with my studies and future job, etc.   \nA little while after that, when some more people had left MIL and SIL are sitting near me and that's when MIL asks me about my education.   \n\"Why would you want to go to college?\" she asks.   \nI explain to her what I was studying and hoping to do after graduation and any potential future jobs. She is all very disinterested in this. Under her breath I hear her mock me, saying, \"Oh, college, college.\" In a high pitched, exaggerated voice. Apparently to her, me going to college is me pretending to be something I'm not and thinking I'm better than what I actually am. (For those that don't know, MIL had an issue with me being mixed race and my humble start in life. To her, I should've stayed on 'my side of town.')  \nShe then tries to tell me that I don't need further education because I've got a husband and I can just rely on him and be a housewife and a lady of leisure, etc. I don't need to work as I have a man now and he can work and earn money and I can take care of things in the house. Now, my ex-husband is a very talented cook. We both enjoy cooking and trying new recipes. We used to share the housework and the chores because both of us lived in the house. It was our house, so why not both help out? That was one thing MIL used to like to talk about as well. A man shouldn't be expected to come home and have to work again and do jobs around the house. He's been out working all day he should expect to come home to a hot meal. When I reminded MIL that I worked also and was out of the house, in a very condescending manner she said to me, \"Yes but he works harder than you do dear.\"  \nSo MIL's thing was that women should apparently choose looks over books. MIL chose looks and that's why she had the nice house and successful husband, etc. ( I never say this about other women, as I believe all women are beautiful, but MIL was not as pretty as she thought herself to be. She used to go on and on about her looks and how lucky her husband was to marry someone who was such a rare beauty like she was) and apparently women who chose books are miserable and have nothing in life because men don't go for that.   \nMIL had so many effed up opinions. One of my husband's cousins is a lesbian and MIL used to go on and on about how accepting she was of this and how she didn't have a problem and she was so good towards 'those people', but then she'd refer to it as an illness and mental affliction, etc. \"It's a disease, what she has. She'll get better one day.\"  \nI am still really good friends with my ex-husband, we still get along great and thankfully he's not like his family at all, but I'm glad I got out of there when I did.

The thing editors appreciate more than a story, is source consent.\nContext for my hellbeast mum is in the bot.\nI went NC with her after work on Friday. I'd been thinking about it ages, and she kind of forced me to do it for a few reasons.\nReason the first: She has sprung a trip on us over Easter. She called and said and she had taken a bunch of time off over Easter and she was coming down. She hadn't considered that maybe my D(ear)H might have wanted to travel for Easter? Turns out that Covid happened and Australia shut down a bunch of borders. I planned on doing it then, but I don't think I was prepared for it then.\nReason the second: I'd been talking to my therapist about my mother having a drunken tantrum about grandmother's death. She helped herself to my husband's bar, got blind drunk and was listening to sad music in a dark room. I asked her to apologise to my husband about helping herself to the bar and she flew off the handle. I told my husband about this and he said, \"Do you remember her telling me to leave you?\" Apparently I had repressed the memory of her crying about being an awful mother and telling my DH to leave me because I would turn into her.\nReason the third: Stories from my wedding and her behaviour keep popping up, and the final straw came from my best friend. Her partner came over from Texas to see her and was in town for our wedding. My mother, in a drunken state, was berating him for being American, being Texan, having guns, and voting for Trump (he didn't, and he's a responsible gun owner). I apologised for my mum's behaviour at my wedding to my best friend and I realised that this isn't something I should do.\nI spoke to my therapist, who reassured me that whatever I did, it would be a decision made from a rational place, as well as a place of protection.\nI wrote a script to keep myself on task, I set a date and had my husband beside me. And I did it.\nAll she said was \"Very well, goodbye.\" It was cold.\nIt broke my heart. I don't believe she's a bad parent, I believe she had bad role models (her parents were shit) and a god awful tragedy (my dad dying when I was 4) that triggered everything.

Long time reader, and I made an account to post this.\nSo little background on my DH and I. He and I met in college. I was dating a guy at the time and husband still thought he was straight. After drinking a few beers together one night we hooked up. I felt terrible because I cheated so I broke up with my boyfriend, and DH was confused because he always thought he was straight (I mean obviously he wasn't.) About six months later, he being 24 and me 22, we started dating. I was kept a secret because DH was terrified because of his parents religious beliefs. I was introduced as his \"friend\" for two years before getting caught kissing. His family was split, half saying he needed christ, and half saying they accepted him. His mom, and two of his sisters did not accept him (he had 4 siblings, three sisters and one brother.)\nWhen we got married around 2015 (we made a quick plan after gay marriage was legalized.) The family that disapproved refused to show, besides JNMIL because she was FIL date. And yes, they did try to mess up the wedding. Tried to knock over the cake, tried to mess up the playlist, tried to ruin my dance with my mom, and finally tried to put wine on me (my mom and dad are very protective.) This also embarrassed FIL, and was the final straw in a big pile of things, and was lead to a divorce.\nFinally a little over two years ago, the only sister that accepted DH's sexuality and his and my relationship got in a car crash. She died a few days later. Her husband and son (9 at the time, 11 now) were distraught. Her husband couldn't deal with it and asked DH and I to take his son (now DN (dear nephew)). We took him in and he still calls us his uncles. JNMIL is still pissed DH isn't having kids of his own and that we got DN and not her.\n\u200b\nNow to the story. Due to this pandemic, and JNMILs incredible manipulation, she has been staying with us. DH, DN, JNMIL, and I were in the living room playing board games and watching movies. DH went to the kitchen with DN to start making cookies. JNMIL looked at me and it kinda went down like this.\nJNMIL: \"So, is DN just a replacement then?\"\nMe: \"I'm sorry, replacement?\"\nJNMIL: \"For a child, DH said you always wanted kids. And I know he always did. Now your both in your mid-thirties. So, naturally I have to think DN is a replacement of sorts since you two obviously can't have children.\"\nMe: \"Children aren't things, they aren't just place holders for each other. DH and I obviously wanted kids but things don't work out sometimes.\"\nJNMIL: \"Yes, I'm sure that how you view it. But is that how DH views it?\"\nMe: \"WE will talk about it with each other, thank you.\"\nJNMIL rolled her eyes. \"Just seems like things are getting old with you two.\"\nI don't know why but that made me panic. And she picked up on that. For the next few days she had been tormenting me by brining up all the thing DH and I hadn't done together (going on vacation to certain places, having kids, how we got together so young etc.) Things I didn't even know DH was telling her. I am scared that this might not be a manipulation attempt but her warning me. I know she hates me but maybe this is her claiming her victory? Does that make sense?

Overall is very laid back cat that we are so lucky to have and for the baby to meet one day and grow up with. Now,we try to not be up in her face unless she ppl us her face close to ours. Now if we do aggravate her or she is uncomfortable and we notice we do give her some space, a minute or two to herself so she doesn't feel threatened. We back off give her room and try to give her as many escape routes as possible.This has almost never failed till today. \nNow MIL has 2 small \"toy breeds\" (a Yorkie and a Maltese mix) that she \"cares\" for but she does some questionable care for them. Her at home grooming it pretty rough around the face and especially on the ears.  Outside of grooming shell just pick them up whenever with one hand,or be all up in there face. If they are near her when she wants them she will pull them to her. This behavior with these small toy breeds is something DH,FIL,and I are uncomfortable with but she really doesn't listen much. FIL calls it out often but he hasn't had much luck getting her to change her ways.\nFIL,worked for a kennel registered breeder for a period of time. His family was in the business of breeding dogs(I belive they were boxers,I don't know the actual name but the coat is similar in length and texture). So he is aware of how some actions can lead to bad things,and has dealt with multiple problems with some of the puppies and dogs. Our family vet is aware of his family's business and what he has done and occasionally they will have FIL fix a issue(ingrown nail,a bad tooth,occasionally a stitch that wasn't full removed).\nSo,I have posted on here before and well same lady. We were all chill but...it clearly didn't last. So DH and I have a 5 year old mainecoon mix.  Recently I noticed her lickng and bitting at a chunk of fur on her lower belly. I groomed down what I could of her fur before I reached the knot. This tiny clump of fire wrapped in a half in-half out out stitch. The skin around it was irritated and me not knowing what a possible infection would look like I told her vet and she is being seen tomorrow to have it removed. Now I told MIL about my recently discovery and she immediately tries to pick her up and force her on her back to see where it is and how bad it is. My cat is clearly un comfortable. I try to separate her and my cat but she pulls my cat closer,being now within an inch of my cats face. This is something we don't try to let happen with her.  MiL tried to find it but pulling at her fur and gets hissed at. I was not having it so I removed her arms off my cat and requested we leave her alone. We go into the dinning room and MIL slightly angered,by my actions towards her i can only guess suggests, suggests in front of FIL and DH that we don't need to pay for the vet bill,we can have FIL just cut it out. DH and I said no thank you,MIL proceed to remind us he has had to do it before on dogs. I kindly sighed and responded \"thank you but I don't think that is the safest option. She has fur entangled into the stich and we can't really see if its infected or not. The vet ask that we isolate her to a room and watch her to make sure she doesn't pull it out on her own\". MIL WAS ENRAGED BY THIS. She looked at FIL in disbelief.  I couldn't tell weather she was mad at me for separating her from my cat or for denying her offer of help.. FIL,being the most sane person and the most reasonable out of DH's parents. Nodded as he replied \"If the vet thinks it could possibly be infected its better if I don't mess with it\". DH trying to lighten the tension \"our poor baby is gonna have a bald spot tomorrow\" .it works for me,himself,and FIL but MIL was still mad. I returned into the room while DH and FIL discussed how the vet will possibly handle the situation. Now this conversation last a good 5 to 7 minutes so I figured mabye my cat would be cooled down and would be fine if I walked in and sat next to her. This was not the case. I was hissed at for going near her. She was laying on the foot of the bed and was instantly hissing and sat up and held up a paw. I got pawed at with ears back fully. I took this as a sign to just leave her alone for alittle bit longer. I walked out and told the IL's that the vet ask we restrain from touching her belly,picking her up,and letting her do heavy activity till the stitches are removed. MIL,just gave a eye roll,and went to go do who knows what I left the room. Me and DH have never seen our cat act like this. We talked to FIl about MIL actions and how she ignored my cats signs of being uncomfortable and I was uncomfortable with how she was handling my cat like she does her dogs. He wasn't surprised by  her actions and treatment of my cat. He had a guilty look but couldn't seem to come up with words.  None of us can understand how she finds her actions with her \"pets\" okay and normal.

Everytime she sees him and tries to hold him, he freaks out for me or his dad. I like to take him back and make him comfortable as soon as possible, but she wants me to ignore his cries and let her hold him because he's not in any real danger. \nShe comes from a time where kids didn't have opinions, or body autonomy and were supposed to fit into your life.

He just screams and screams until he passes out from exhaustion, covered in sweat and tears. And now whenever he goes over and needs a nap, she puts him in a playpen and lets him cry it out. \nHow do I navigate this while keeping our relationship intact? I want to be firm but polite.

She left DH with his step father to raise, which thankfully he did. I don't really know what she did during this time other than being a druggie and homeless, and calling my DH on his birthday every year being drunk.\nBut I guess eventually she got her act together and she and DH reconnected when he graduated high school. He ended up move to the state she lived in to be close to her, and everything was great right? Maybe she went through a mental crisis, or maybe she didn't have what it takes to be a mother, but a decent adult right? No wrong. Like any old jug of expired milk, she belongs in the garbage!\nShe didn't really want to reconnect with my DH, she just wanted to use him for money. She kept all his money and would give him what he needed. She eventually decided to move several states away with her dead best friend's husband (a lot of shady shit in that story) and DH moved to my state for our relationship, we started out as long distance, met through friends. We will be married 10 years this year, and I have only met this woman once! Thank god! Throughout our years she:\n\nNever came to our wedding or told us congratulations. \nOn holidays, she would turn her phone off so my husband couldn't get ahold of her, and then cry to DH that he didn't call and say \"Merry/Happy whatever\"\nConstantly played this phone game, where she would text or message my DH that he needed to call for something important, or she had bad news like she was dying (this woman has been dying for seven damn years!) And when my DH called, would berate him and tell him he was a bad son for not calling her more often.\nWould constantly visit relatives, but not us, even though we were on the way to her destination\nTried to give me parenting advice after our ODD was born.\nDrunk calls to DH and myself\nNever ever, not once told my oldest DD Happy Birthday, or Merry Christmas or even sent a card. She thinks she is grandmother of the year, but ODD doesn't even know who she is, and Expired Milk doesn't even know we had a second DD! \nAlways posting on the book of faces what a great mom she is, how she loves and thinks of her son and grandchild everyday\nWhen my stepfather past away unexpected, she sent me a FB message about how she knows how my mom feels because her husband has dementia and will die.... someday. I replied, at least you still have him, cherish the time. This bitch said \"Not for much longer\" That was 3 years ago, and I am pretty sure he is still alive. \n\nAnyways, I have been NC with her for about 7 years, and DH went from VVVLC to NC with her last year by just dropping the rope and not responding to her guilt ridden \"I'm dying call me\" texts. Which fortunately for us, it's easy because of distance and her sheer uninterest. However DHs birthday was last week, and nothing from her. No call, no text, not even a FB message.

I am on the verge of tears and I really need some advice. Me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 4 years. We never really have any problems other than when we fight about his mother. Long story short, my boyfriend is a victim of emotional incest from his mother. She\u2019s always been crazy, possessive and obsessed of my boyfriend from the beginning. The first year of our relationship, she made tantrums when he wanted to hang out with me instead of her, jump on his bed at night and demand cuddles and movie nights as she clung on his arms and kisses him on the lips without his permission. The thing is, he\u2019s not the typical momma\u2019s boy who enjoys this. He tell me that the things his mom does makes him uncomfortable but I think the way his mom raised him made him very insecure and he never stands up for himself so he genuinely feels bad and never tells her no. \nWe\u2019ve had countless fights about her. The most recent one being the coronavirus. His parents are rich and his mom and step dad fight all the time so they purchased an apartment for the mother to go to whenever the fought. Well, they\u2019ve been fighting plenty so she\u2019s been 24/7. Fast forward you the coronavirus, her mother has a coworker she interacts with everyday that tested positive. Upon knowing this, I immediately told him that he should tell his mom to self-isolate in the apartment so she doesn\u2019t spread it to him, his brother and his step father. My bf is also coming over in 2 weeks for something school related as we are graduating seniors where he will self quarantine with me and family in our home. (He is from LA, I\u2019m from SF) The thing is, his mom is genuinely dumb and can\u2019t live without seeing her precious sons. She refuses to self isolate/quarantine because she says she \u201cfeels fine\u201d even though I keep telling my boyfriend that symptoms don\u2019t usually show up until 2 weeks. My bf feels the same way but yet again, he\u2019s too scared and he feels bad to tell her that so he broke social distancing rules and hung out with her by going on a drive for a couple hours, getting food together and watching a movie etc. Normally I would probably just tell him to keep his distance and just shut up if he and his mom don\u2019t listen but what really aggravates me if the fact that he\u2019s coming to my family\u2019s house and may spread it to me and my family. The next day after this argument, him and his mother STILL didn\u2019t listen and went on a hike together. (The weird thing is, his mom also purposely doesn\u2019t invite her husband and my bf\u2019s brother; she only wants it to be her and my bf every single time)\nI can go on and tell you all more horror stories of what she\u2019s done but it will be VERY long. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I feel defeated. I feel like he will never stand up to her. Deep down I know I don\u2019t want to date someone like that but he makes me feel very guilt for wanting to break up and calls me a \u201cdictator\u201d for making that decision. At the same time, I don\u2019t know if I should be patient and wait for the day for him to grow, learn and stand up to her. Thoughts?\nTl;dr my bf never stands up to his mom and is too scared to do so in fear that he\u2019ll hurt her feelings. What should I do? I don\u2019t know if I should leave or stay.\n\n"}], [{"title": "Old St Nope called me \u201cLove\u201d  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "48", "comments": "21", "content": "OSN is my appears ever so saintly MiL, who wears a halo for everyone else except me.

When my mother died two years ago and not a single family member reached out to me, I said screw it and dropped the rope. \nBitchbot (ow whatever it\u2019s called now) has your back on my previous post. To recap mil was sending many messages via the box of faces because I\u2019ve come down with covid.  Since then I\u2019ve ignored her, and the messages for the most part have slowed and even stopped. Until we had to retest our two year old because he\u2019s got a cough. (Still waiting on results - I\u2019m quarantined in the basement with him to keep him separate from everyone else - I\u2019m supposed to not be contagious anymore as I\u2019m almost three weeks post first symptom, but I\u2019m exhausted and still not feeling well)\nSo two evenings ago, after hitting the testing center with the toddler, I received another message from her. Of course I do. But she starts it with an affectionate address - \u201cHi Love, ......\u201d and I\u2019m just grossed out for so many reasons. \nOne - we do NOT have a close relationship.  Last time she sent me a message was when I was in the hospital last summer (donated part of my liver and suddenly she\u2019s messaging me again). time before that was Christmas months before, and before that it was the Christmas two years ago.   So. You can see. Not. Close.  (There were emails between us a few times last summer as she gave a fauxpology for everything that could have possibly offended me.  Everything except the things I directly told her I wanted apologies for)\nTwo - Love is what I call my husband.  And what he calls me. I would never use that term of endearment for anyone else. Not a child. And not a parent. And I find it very disconcerting for her to be using it towards me.  I call my kids Hon, babe, sweetie, even goober and brat. But never love. \nI\u2019ve ignored OSN for the most part. And I just look the other way when she drives me nuts because I have zero intention of giving her any F@cks.  But this creeps me out and I feel I need to say something. But the truth is no matter how polite I would be this will be a bee in her bonnet.   So. To send or not to send a reply?

Now I'm just curious how this will play out.  If the golden feels comfortable with vacation and we don't that's going to put additional stress and guilt where at this time it shouldn't be, no one should be pressured into anything they aren't comfortable with.  I did tell him I'm absolutely not comfortable with it, especially after they go on vacation somewhere they will be on the road traveling to, sight seeing and eating out then coming to our house to stay.  It seems extremely risky.  We have stayed home since middle of March and just remained very cautious about everything we've done.  To open the house up to people not doing that, traveling from the other side of the state does not seem smart.  I respect everyone's right to decide what is best for them but also hope we are respected in the same way.  Time will tell.  My anxiety definitely up-ticked hardcore from her even asking right now.

Im going to tell a story about something that happened last year with JNMIL. I\u2019m just venting. I don\u2019t have anyone who knows me or my situation well enough to vent to, and I don\u2019t want to do it to DH because that is his mother. \nTRIGGER WARNING- MENTION OF DRUGS \nTLDR; MIL abandons DS to run off with new lover, leaves us with no child care, gets addicted to drugs, still wants to be involved to this day\nSo I\u2019ll start with when I met MIL. She seemed nice enough but a little standoffish towards me. I noticed right off the bat she was sort of slow-speaking, and acted like a teenager. Not annoying or anything but, always wanted a bunch of friends around, always wanted out of the house, and she smoked weed. I have no judgements towards anyone who smokes, it was just different for me because when I was growing up I never met a grown up who smoked weed (that I knew of).\nAnyways, DH and I got pregnant and we talked to MIL a lot about babysitting once DS was born. We hashed everything out and she said she would be happy to. 6 weeks after having DS I went back to work.\nThings were good for about 8 months. Then her behavior became more erratic. There were a lot of times that I would be on the way to drop DS off and she would not be there (she doesn\u2019t work). I had to wake up her husband (DH\u2019s stepdad), because I\u2019d have to be at work 20 minutes later. She didn\u2019t understand that because she was late to everything doesn\u2019t mean I was going to be late too. She\u2019d get mad at me for waking her husband up because he worked 2nd shift at the time. But what am I supposed to do??\nSo that went on for about a month. Then she would have friends over every single time I dropped DS off. There were a few sketchy people but I didn\u2019t really have a choice of who I\u2019d be dropping my son off to, she was our only option. One time I came to pick him up and the whole apartment smelled like weed.\nLike I said, I do not judge if other people smoke. I personally don\u2019t but my husband does. But he knows not to do it in front of our baby. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time but I asked DH to say something. He did and MIL said it wouldn\u2019t happen again. A few weeks later.. the falling out happened.\nI had to work late one day and I texted MIL telling her I would be 2 hours late and to ask DH if he could pick up DS. What I didn\u2019t know at the time is DH was working late too. My bad, I didn\u2019t think it was that big a deal as DS would likely be sleeping anyways. When I look back I can see how it could be perceived as inconsiderate though. \nI got off 2 hours late and raced over to see if DS was still there, and he was. MIL was pissed. But this was also the first time this had ever happened, in my defense. Anyways, MIL proceeded to yell at me in front of my son (and her friend that she had over). I get the being pissed part. I really do. But you cannot yell at me in front of my son. I packed his stuff up and apologized and left. She said don\u2019t come back tomorrow. \nWe figured something out. I don\u2019t remember, I think one of us had to call into work. But I made sure to let DH know what his mother had said to me the night before. He was as pissed as I was. He told her not to speak to me like that again or she would never see her grandson again. \nA few days after that I drop him off again. MIL apologizes for the other day, saying there was a lot of drama going on at home. Her car got keyed by someone, I was like dang that sucks. Trying to sympathize. We patched things up.\nA week later I\u2019m getting ready for work when MIL texts me saying her husband is going to watch DS that day. She says she\u2019s staying in another city and we probably don\u2019t want DS to be where she is (because that side of town has a lot of drugs) \u201cbut it\u2019s up to us\u201d. I say ok, I\u2019ll drop him off with your husband. \nI show up and her husband had no idea about this conversation. She didn\u2019t even SPEAK to him about watching DS that day. That was the day she ran off with her lover. Because of her recent behavior (there\u2019s more that I didn\u2019t include here), I was scared to death all week that I would drop him off with her husband and she would come and take him away, to some strangers house 2 cities away. \nLuckily for DH and I, MIL\u2019s husband was laid off just that week. Thank god he cleared his schedule for us, or I definitely would have had to quit my job on the spot to watch my son. The next week we put him in daycare. The daycares in my area are hard to get into. Every single one I called was completely full except one, the one he got into, our only choice. \nSo weeks go by and every now and then we\u2019ll hear through MIL\u2019s friends that she\u2019s on this drug or that drug, that they saw her and she looked like she lost 50 pounds, that she\u2019s living in her car etc. Its been almost a year now since she\u2019s abandoned DS. \nMIL keeps asking for help financially as her and her lover both don\u2019t have a job and are going from couch to couch. We definitely can\u2019t help and we aren\u2019t letting her stay in our home, not after what she did and how she treated me. I do not feel sympathy. She is a compulsive liar and will say anything if you give her money. \nAround Christmas time, she went back to stay with her husband (they are still married to this day). We took DS to see her and tell her to stop messing with her lover, that person is a bad influence and they are making her into a version of herself that is unrecognizable. We told her she needs to go to rehab, live with her dad if that would help, and get some real help. \nShe broke down in tears saying things like \u201cif you only knew how bad I\u2019ve wanted to get out..\u201d or \u201cyou have no idea the things I\u2019ve been through\u201d. Well, turns out it was all BS to have somewhere to stay for the holidays. At this point I had already blocked her number and all social media\u2019s, but DH told me she had posted a selfie the next day of her and her lover cuddling on the couch in the living room of her husbands apartment. \nShe went on to keep asking DH and other family members for money, and almost everyone says no every time. MIL\u2019s father has a soft spot though. Truly a wonderful man. He\u2019s at a complete loss. He calls DH every other day, saying I don\u2019t know what to do with her, I don\u2019t know if I should lend her money. DH doesn\u2019t want to be involved after what happened at Christmas. \nAt this point DH accepts that MIL got herself into the situation she\u2019s in and she will not get help. He will not lend her money and he also accepts at this point that he could get a call at any given time that his mother had passed away.  He assures me that MIL was a normal mother when he was a kid but she got into a car accident with a SEPARATE LOVER (whole other story), and has had a few strokes and she isn\u2019t the same anymore. \nNow, DS goes to grandpas house (DH\u2019s dad, MIL\u2019s ex-husband) every week and I\u2019ve been hearing MIL\u2019s been visiting him. Honestly I don\u2019t want him to see her, I don\u2019t want him to know who she is, I don\u2019t even want her to touch him or play with him. I\u2019ll always see her as the one who abandoned our son when we needed her. Honestly, in my humble opinion, she is a disgusting person and I wish she would either just go back to her husband or go away for good. She wants to have her cake and eat it too. \nMy son is only 1 now (almost 2). So he doesn\u2019t know what happened, and to my knowledge he doesn\u2019t even recognize MIL anymore. Ngl I\u2019m kind of glad he doesn\u2019t. The last thing I want is for my son to get hurt by someone as careless and negligent as MIL. Obviously he wouldn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s not his fault. And obviously I wouldn\u2019t ever tell him all this, that\u2019s why I\u2019m venting here. \nThere are a few more things I\u2019d like to vent about MIL, if I may. For one thing, she has a 16 year old daughter. Not only did she abandon DS, she also abandoned her own daughter, and this is the SECOND time this has happened to her. I truly feel sorry for my sister in law. She doesn\u2019t show it but I know she\u2019s hurt by it. \nAnd then there was tax season. Oh god. So MIL\u2019s been trying to get money from all different sources (except for working of course), for her drugs. That\u2019s all she cares about at this point. Drugs and her lover (who beats her, allegedly). So at tax season, first of all, this bitch filed head of household. How can you be head of household with no job??? Just insulting. Then she got money back because of sister in law. Because she is a dependent. \nHere\u2019s where things are especially fucked up with their relationship. So she abandons her, right? Well sister in law went to live with her girlfriend, and her girlfriends mom is fully supporting her. Feeding her. Putting a roof over her head. Do you want to know how much money MIL gave SIL or SIL\u2019s gf\u2019s mom??? Nothing. Not. A. Thing. Of course. \nSo there was that, and then the fact that she got a stimulus check with an extra $500 for SIL and SIL saw none of it. SIL works 2 jobs and has no car.\nI\u2019m sorry, but MIL is such a piece of shit. I\u2019ve never been close to her and I feel no sympathy towards her. The way I see it, is if she wanted help she could get it. But she doesn\u2019t. She wants to keep using drugs and being with her lover. Meanwhile she\u2019s still getting her way and seeing our son. I just don\u2019t get her. She\u2019s absolutely the most selfish person that I know. \nDH feels bad for her but knows there is nothin he can do to help. We\u2019ve found another option for child care recently, so we can save some money thankfully. I just want to go on with my life and not see her again. But I know I have to, or at least I\u2019ll have to hear about whatever dumb shit she done that day. \nI hope if anyone reads this that they can understand I am writing all this out of pure emotion. All of this has happened in the past year or so. I don\u2019t mean to sound like someone who has no sympathy for drug users or addicts, because I truly do. But for her I don\u2019t. I understand that addiction is an illness and those people need help. \nPlease comment if you have a similar story, I love to read this subreddit but I feel like I don\u2019t see many posts similar to my situation. I would love to support anyone going through the same thing as me.\n\n"}, {"title": "I\u2019m definitely going VLC now  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "45", "comments": "6", "content": "TW: mentions of abuse and addiction. I do not give permission for this story to be shared elsewhere. \nSo before I dive into things, there\u2019s a little bit of backstory here. Both my fianc\u00e9 and I growing up had fathers with an alcohol problem. We\u2019ve both dealt with emotional/physical abuse as a result of it. We\u2019re both very well aware that addiction runs in both of our families and if we are going through a tough time, we make sure to talk to someone and get help instead of turning to a substance. Our experiences growing up with addiction have made us want to ensure we don\u2019t end up like that. \nDuring the quarantine, there has been a lot more downtime and we\u2019ve been drinking a little more than normal (like many other people during this time). We don\u2019t drink every day and we\u2019re not chugging bottles. My fianc\u00e9 was talking to his mom a few weeks back and she was asking of our plans for the evening. He told her we were going to the grocery store for a few supplies and to replenish the vodka. She grew very concerned and point blank started accusing him of having an alcohol problem and went on a whole lecture about how she was concerned he was going to turn into his dad. He ended that conversation after that. She brought it up again a few more times after that and is now fully convinced he\u2019s an alcoholic. \nDuring the quarantine, his JustYes aunt, who lives in the suburbs has been kind enough to allow us to bring our dogs over to her backyard once in awhile to let them run around since all the dog parks are closed. We don\u2019t go inside at all; she usually stands out on our back deck and talks to us from above, and we always have masks on, and the doggos are happy. FMIL catches wind of this happening and decides that she wants us to bring the dogs to her yard next time (despite her telling people not to come by her house at all during all this craziness). \nSo fast forward to yesterday. We go over there with our dogs and I just have a gut feeling this visit is gonna be a shitshow. The second we get there, FMIL immediately gives my fianc\u00e9 a laundry list of chores of him to do. He obliges because his mom is a narcissist that will guilt trip him and make him feel like shit He\u2019s not around at all for the whole visit. FMIL decides to use this one on one time in the yard to interrogate me about her son. She once again brought up that she\u2019s worried he has a drinking problem. That alone pissed me off, but what she said next made me want to officially go VLC with her. She had the fucking nerve to ask me \u201cwhat kind of drunk he was\u201d, trying to suggest he\u2018s aggressive like his dad was. \nI had zero energy to deal with her bullshit or to argue with her.  I got up, risked myself getting the corona just to go into the house to get my fianc\u00e9 and tell him I was packing up the dogs and that we were leaving. I told him that she\u2019s starting on her bullshit again and I can\u2019t deal with it. All of a sudden, FMIL comes storming up the stairs and my fianc\u00e9 really laid it into her and we left not long after that. Before we left, she came back to him and gave him a hug (which also is a big no no during this time) and said she was sorry and tried to make an excuse for it. \nI refuse to go back over to her house or to willingly interact with her. I have point blank told my fianc\u00e9 this and he is supportive and understand. He himself doesn\u2019t even feel comfortable going over there anymore either. My fianc\u00e9 is not his father. He\u2019s the farthest thing from aggressive and wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. And most of all, he is most definitely NOT an alcoholic. Having grown up with an alcoholic father, I know the classic signs/behaviors and he does not present any of them. \nUnfortunately, his family culture also is going to make this difficult to go VLC (they\u2019re the kind of folks that live by the whole \u201cfamily is family\u201d mantra and just brush all the toxicity in their family under the rug and put on this charade that they\u2019re all perfect and close and lovey dovey). As it is, I already don\u2019t have a good relationship with FMIL (because of bullshit like this) and his family gives me a lot grief for it.\n\n"}, {"title": "My JNMILs, My Baby shower and My Breakdown  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "54", "comments": "7", "content": "Hi! Back again. I wish I didn\u2019t have this much shit to process via Reddit but here we are. On mobile. Please don\u2019t use my post outside of Reddit. I did not plan this but the baby shower happened exactly one year ago today! Lol\nI have posted about my JNMIL and my JNFIL & JNSMIL. Now I can talk about the baby shower. As usual, I\u2019m a \u201cdetails\u201d person so this is hella long. This also might be confusing because I go back and fourth talking about all the in-laws. \nI didn\u2019t originally want a baby shower due to DF\u2019s family starting drama. My mom convinced me to not let his family ruin a special day for us so I agreed to a baby shower. My conditions to letting her throw me one was that it be coed and it be kept intimate and small with only closest family/friends. \nMy mom was super respectful. She let me pick the theme and always asked for my opinion if there was something she wasn\u2019t sure about. She didn\u2019t want this to be about her or uncomfortable for me or DF. \nMIL on the other hand made this a super miserable experience leading up to the event. \nMy mom asked her for help putting together some decorations. My MIL decided that this wasn\u2019t enough. She went overboard (no one asked her to do more than what was expected) and we didn\u2019t realize she did until like maybe a week beforehand, which I\u2019ll get to. She picked fights with my mom and cried to everyone when she wasn\u2019t getting her way. \nShe was simply not listening to anyone. She was planning a shower for HER. She tried to include something that would have most definitely triggered a panic attack for me and she knew it would but didn\u2019t care because she wanted it. She was causing so much drama and that was causing a lot of stress for DF and I. My mom did her best to keep the drama away from us. \nMy SMIL and FIL also contributed to the drama. Before we even started planning the shower, we told EVERYONE that we were keeping the shower simple and small. We reminded FIL and SMIL more than once because they are huge show offs. \nOne time, SMIL started inviting people that I didn\u2019t know and DF met once FROM HER SIDE of the family, in front of me. I was seething.\nCloser to the day of the shower, my mom reaches out to SMIL to ask for their list of people they wanted to invite. My mom receives a SPREADSHEET of 50 fucking people. This was a week after we had reminded them we were not inviting a lot of people. Most of the people were people from her side. I was soooooo mad. We capped the guest list at 50 people but were not even aiming to invite that many people. I started getting anxious picturing that many people who I don\u2019t know at an event that is very personal to me with none of my friends or family there because we didn\u2019t have enough invites/food/drinks to accommodate that list and the people we wanted to invite. I started typing up an email to FIL and SMIL when DF (still in fog) asked me not to say anything. He will handle it. \nWe were discussing what to do and had decided to have my mom send us the list she was sent so we could decide who, out of that list, we wanted to invite. Unfortunately my mom had already sent out the invites. She said she didn\u2019t want to start drama. She bought more so that we could also invite our friends and my family.\nBUT WAIT! There\u2019s more...\nSMIL waited months before asking if my mom needed any help (she wanted all of us to kiss her ass and cater to her). So when she finally got the hint that she has to be an adult (she is in her 60\u2019s btw) and ask herself, my mom really had nothing for her to do. My mom asked them to bring beverages to placate them and their need to do something. But they were upset that is all they were asked to help with. So ultimately, SMIL really wasn\u2019t involved. And I didn\u2019t really mind...she had just recently treated me like garbage and expected to be an integral part of planning this special day, I think not. I knew she (and FIL) only wanted to help because she/they wanted the recognition. And what they did next proved me right...\nThe invitations had gone out and we had a peaceful break while everyone was receiving them. \nThis is where I introduce to you, my JN(step)SIL, our first FM. SSIL (who lived out of state so they went out of their way to call her just to talk shit) calls DF one day and starts going on about how SMIL and FIL talked to her about how they are upset that their names were not on OUR baby shower invitations. Uh, what? She says she would never think about leaving FIL\u2019s (her stepfather) name off of her wedding invitation and it was disrespectful that we did this to her mom. She said DF and I need to call them and apologize. DF JADED hard (which annoyed me) and gave her too much information as she is not involved whatsoever...and they ended the call. So again they decided to act passive aggressively instead of coming to us to let us know that they were upset and why. \nSide note: the only names that were listed were my mom\u2019s and MIL\u2019s as contacts to RSVP to, and their info was in tiny font at the bottom of the invitation. My dad, stepmom, birth father/his wife, birth mom, FIL & SMIL were all NOT listed on the invitation. Because they did not plan the shower so why would we have people call them to RSVP? Lol they were definitely not the only people left off of the invites. \nI don\u2019t know if it was the pregnancy hormones, the stress from the drama or the lack of sleep I was getting but I completely broke down. I just started bawling uncontrollably and then I got so worked up I started hyperventilating. DF was almost in tears seeing me like that. Once I calmed down I had decided I wanted to just cancel the shower. My DF was pissed his family was causing so much drama. I spent the rest of the day thinking it over and deciding whether or not to call my mom to cancel. I decided not to because of all the work and money she had already put into it. \nMy birthday was a few days before the shower and I had some family come in from out of town. So me, DF and my family that was able to make it all went out to dinner to celebrate my birthday. And if you guessed my in-laws were butthurt they were not invited to a dinner to celebrate me, you guessed right but I couldn\u2019t have cared less. They didn\u2019t/don\u2019t care about me so why would I invite them?\nMIL said to my mom a week before the shower while discussing the plans: \u201cThis is called planning.  I'm doing all the prep work and you are just showing up.  Appreciate that and just say thanks.\u201d My mom paid for the majority of the shower and was out of state. She definitely was doing a lot of prep just from afar and would be doing lots in a short amount of time when she arrived. MIL later bitched to us about how much time and money she \u201chad\u201d to spend.\nThe shower itself was okay. Nothing super crazy happened. Almost no one from SMIL\u2019s list came (to my relief). SMIL and FIL came. SMIL was fake nice and pouted the whole time. I was just happy to see family I hadn\u2019t seen in a while since I lived far from everyone. \nDF and I thanked everyone for coming and thanked my mom and MIL for putting the shower together. Epic CBF from SMIL as I looked right at her after we said this lol I know that was petty but I had to have a little fun at my shower!\nMy mom tried to salvage the day for us but at the end of this whole ordeal we were all emotionally exhausted and happy to get the damn thing over with.\n\n"}, {"title": "Beginning of the In-Law fiasco, providing nightmares for a century  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "33", "comments": "9", "content": "Hello!

It was a music festival, so I thought, this should be fun so why the heck not.\nOn the day of, we were in no rush to get there since we were on the afternoon shift and we were kind of extra employees in case the booth got extra busy. We finally get there, and JNFIL directs me to a parking space. He is noticeably angry, albeit quietly. I brushed it off as a personality quirk. \nWe get to the booth and I say hi to JNMIL, SIL, and the owner of the booth. Immediately, SIL pulls us to the back to \u2018get our IDs\u2019. Instead, she starts tearing SO apart. \u201cYou were supposed to be here hours ago! You were supposed to take over MY shift. I have 3 jobs and kids and you decide to spend all your time with this bitch right here,\u201d gesturing to me obviously. I am sitting here like, \u2018what the heck is going on\u2019. And even weirder, MIL is smiling at me? \nSIL goes on and on about \u2018this bitch\u2019. I just awkwardly stood there and waited for it to be over. BF just stood there and took it with a blank look on his face. Apparently, he was covering her shift, but no one let us know! That doesn\u2019t placate her. But, I don\u2019t let it ruin my night. It sounded like she was very stressed if she did in fact have 3 jobs and a kid (actually she has 3 jobs, 2 kids , one a newborn, goes to college, and has a POS husband. She is also pretty chill, but in the FOG). MIL tells me, \"We usually aren't this crazy!!!!\" (Note: What a freaking lie)\nThe rest of the night is pretty uneventful. The only other thing that was odd to me was MIL was supposed to teach me a position but she straight up ignored me. So, I asked the owner if I could learn the software he was using as a way to get out of that awkwardness. \nWould any of ya\u2019ll noticed red flags at this point, or had similar experiences? At the time I just brushed it of as \u2018passionate family members\u2019, but now I KNOW that is not true.\n\n"}, {"title": "Update 1: Saint Sandwich and her bitchy moods  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "31", "comments": "5", "content": "Trigger Warning: Suicide \nI used this particular flair because I\u2019m always open to advice, so if you\u2019ve got any in dealing with a sharp tongued holier-than-thou self admitted ice queen please share.\nSorry for formatting on all my posts, I primarily use mobile so my formatting is mostly terrible.

I\u2019m so happy that I can breath now! \nDH is going to talk to his dad today about her inappropriate nasty comments directed at our DD and just let his dad know politely that his mother is in fact the reason he stays away, and if she can\u2019t curb her bullshit we\u2019ll be going away again and it won\u2019t be my fault, though she can blame me all she wants, he is more over it than I am. DH is also going to tell his dad that he\u2019s super disappointed, that I have never done anything to deserve what she is doing and that if it continues she will be breaking what little chance she has left of a happy family, DD doesn\u2019t want to go near her because of this, I have been a nervous wreck because of it and he\u2019s just super not happy at his mothers toxic behavior and he is absolutely sick and tired of nobody (including himself) standing up to her because she\u2019s a bully. \nApparently SS has been this way forever and I\u2019m just a soft target owing to my past, like in the moment she\u2019s looking to wound and I\u2019m easy to wound because I\u2019m carrying a \u201cheavier emotional load\u201d than anyone because I am dealing with some really terrible stuff mentally, I have expressed quite plainly that it is so dangerous for me to be on such a slippery slope. I do not want to end up in the same spot I clawed my way out of and when he asked me to elaborate I did so he understands. \nThe housing market might not open for another 4 months but that\u2019s okay, I can survive if I have boundaries. It\u2019s our anniversary today. We can\u2019t really celebrate, but my god I feel so much lighter knowing that My every move is no longer being monitored day in and day out.\nDH told me just walk away and come straight to him when she starts and if she says anything to DD I must correct her to DD in front of her, sadly he doesn\u2019t understand that I physically cannot do that just yet, But he\u2019s at the point where he feels like everybody tried to talk to her now and it didn\u2019t work, now we\u2019re going to treat her like a child and she goes in time out when she misbehaves just like we handled my mom. \nWe have a game plan, we\u2019ll be moving out and we\u2019re sorry for FIL but they\u2019ll just have to make a plan. If she wanted us to keep helping them then she should have held her tongue and learned to be nice.\nLittle one will only be returning to school in July (if they don\u2019t put us all back in lockdown) I have been a shaky mess these past few days, I\u2019ve lost clumps of hair, I\u2019m dropping everything and tripping over stuff, so as soon as possible I am booking a therapy appointment. \nI\u2019m not in the best place, I\u2019ve just had a family member commit suicide and she realistically could have been saved and I feel a bit guilty that I am breathing a sigh of relief that SS is back at work. I didn\u2019t even realize how heavy the weight on my chest was until it was shifted a little.\nRealistically, her behavior will not change, so I will be back, I hope it\u2019s not too soon, but it\u2019s inevitable. Thank you so much for your collective ear, I so desperately needed somebody to bitch to and you guys are always the best. Love you all!

She knows I do not speak it yet continues to write to me in her language.  I usually translate her messages with an online translator and then get my husband to check my reply which takes ages. Lately, there have been work pressures, health issues and my oldest has speech delays so lots of therapy - stressful times. Then out of the blue I get a long email mainly where she talks about herself and that is bored in quarantine (how presumptuous!) and asks me to send her photos of the kids (that's mainly why she writes). She never really asks me how I am doing or even how the kids are - it's all me, me and me LOL\nThe other day I replied in English but then got a long email in her language again...okaaay. So do you think I need to reply to her in her language just to keep the peace? what do you suggest? I guess I am trying to avoid any conflict with her as she is prone to overdramatizing any situation.

I recently realized that she always had a way of making me constantly feel guilty about everything...even issues in our family that were her own fault she would somehow twist them to make ME feel guilty about it. \nA big thing she does currently is make me feel guilty about phone calls. If she calls and I don\u2019t call back in a timely manner, or if we go several days without talking, she will make sarcastic comments once we do talk such as \u201coh wow look who decided to finally call!\u201d Or \u201coh look who it is! Thank you SO much for taking the time to call me!\u201d It\u2019s gotten to the point that I start getting slight anxiety if I miss a phone call from her and don\u2019t call back, just because I don\u2019t want to listen to the sarcastic comments. \nCurrent situation: my husband and I recently welcomed our first child into the world. Ever since we got home, she has been unbearable with all her criticisms and \u201cadvice.\u201d We have not had ONE conversation that didn\u2019t include her telling me how I\u2019m doing something wrong and what I should be doing instead. \nThe big piece of advice she has been repeating for months is \u201csleep when the baby sleeps.\u201d Innocent enough. However whenever I do nap during the day, I wake up to several missed phone calls or texts from her. Cue my anxiety, so I call back immediately. And that\u2019s when it all starts. \nShe does this thing where she\u2019ll ask me an innocent question (how\u2019s he sleeping? How\u2019s feeding going? What did you guys do today?) and anything I say is wrong. No matter what I say the response is \u201coh god no! What you need to do is....\u201d There has literally not been one response where she was satisfied with how I was handling parenthood. \nOnce when I was talking to her she asked for pictures. My husband sent her one and she immediately found something wrong with it and started lecturing me about how we shouldn\u2019t be doing xyz. \nEven little things...I mentioned how we gave the baby his first sponge bath. What could\u2019ve been a \u201caw what a fun milestone!\u201d Immediately turned to \u201cwell why did he cry? Did you make it fun for him? You probably made the water too cold. How do you know it wasn\u2019t cold? How did you check the temperature? Oh god no...you need to use your elbow to check it! Here\u2019s what you need to do next time...\u201d\nAt times, she\u2019ll even ignore what I actually said to make it sound like I\u2019m doing it wrong so she can give advice. She asked how breastfeeding was going and I said \u201cit\u2019s getting better. My milk finally came in so it got a lot easier and he\u2019s eating constantly now.\u201d She immediately started with the advice \u201cok so no, what I want you to do is make this milk concoction. TRUST ME it\u2019ll help your milk to come in and he\u2019ll actually want to eat it then because it\u2019ll taste better.\u201d I....literally just said my milk is in and he\u2019s eating constantly.

We will be starting our senior years of undergrad and we live at home during breaks from school (and currently in quarantine). We plan to get engaged after college and move to another state where he can start his career and I can begin med school. Throughout our whole relationship, MIL has made snide comments towards me that go mostly unnoticed except by me. I am an atheist and she knows this and SO has been seriously reconsidering his religion. MIL is very Catholic which is the bane of most MIL related issues. One of the biggest problems throughout SO and I\u2019s relationship is that MIL insists on converting me to Catholicism. I was raised Catholic until I was about 12 when my parents let me decide and I chose not to continue practicing, therefore I didn\u2019t make my confirmation. She has made this a point that I must be confirmed, attend church with them, and overall just be converted. His oldest brother (30) has been married for 4 years and MIL also despises SIL just based on the fact that BIL and SIL got pregnant before marriage. Some examples of this are calling SIL a whore for being pregnant before marriage (but it takes two to tango right? her son did not get any issues from her!) and recently berated BIL in front of the whole family (minus SIL) because SIL wanted to take their kids to a certain church and held her ground and MIL insisted on another church. Recently, MIL decided that I am a terrible fit for her son because SO told her that he thought a nearby park would be a lovely place for a wedding and she thinks we must get married in a church. Here is the drama that ensued: \nMIL insisted that we must get married in the church or else he will not be Catholic anymore and cannot raise kids Catholic. She then cried and screamed for 3 hours. When she does this, she does not allow anyone else to speak or she will cry and scream louder.\nMIL and FIL made SO pray the rosary 3 times and then promise to pray the rosary at least twice a day for the next month. \nMIL said that I was evil, immoral, and raised poorly by my parents. She then said I must be trying to convert him to an atheist, despite me saying numerous times I would support any religion SO chooses, would agree to a priest officiating our wedding, and would raise future children Catholic.\nMIL told SO that they would financially cut him off if he did not promise to remain Catholic. FIL is a CEO and they are very wealthy, and therefore have payed for all 3 kid\u2019s college tuition, weddings, and any other financial help they needed.\nMIL said that she respects SO\u2019s choice of religion and if we get married because she loves him, but then continued to pressure him to remain Catholic, to break up with me, and scream and cry at least 4 hours or more a day for the past week. This includes while SO was taking a timed final exam for college.\nMIL said that (before we started quarantining) SO spent too much time at my house (a couple days a week) and she felt as if he cared more about me, did not want to be part of their family anymore, and that he should \u201cjust move in\u201d with me.\nMIL has maintained a midnight curfew for SO (not because he wakes them when he comes home, but because they feel unloved if he is not home in time) and does not allow him to stay over. He has come home at the latest 12:30, but she said because of this he is untrustworthy and they will he moving his curfew to an earlier time.\nAnd finally, the big kicker, today when SO confronted MIL and asked kindly that although he respects and loves her, she be less controlling because he will be moving out in one year and needs to learn to live a little on his own. She then said she\u2019s not controlling, but giving him guidance. She told him a story about how her mother told her brother than his wife was terrible, he did not listen, and then she cheated on him with a drug dealer and said that she is worried SO will suffer the same fate.\nI\u2019m just at a loss for words here. I have been nothing but kind to SO\u2019s family for 2 whole years. SO and I rarely fight, and I love him dearly and have never and will never do anything to harm him. And regarding the cheating comment, my father cheated on my mom when I was 14 and I was extremely upset for years and still have a tumultuous relationship with him 7 years later (and she knows this!). SO assured me that we can move away in a year and she will not have to be involved in our lives, but I feel terrible because they have always been very close.

I do not believe she is a narcissist.\nYesterday I spoke to her for the first time in a while. She wouldn't even look at me on the camera. She asked after my parents and then cut me off to start talking about something completely different. It was the one personal question she asked during the phone call. She rants and talks a million miles an hour and is often angry at something or someone and tells us these stories.

Cause I have the immune system of an amoeba it doesn\u2019t work for anything, hubby has been extra aware of himself anytime he\u2019s had to go out like for groceries. My MIL T-T is a nurse and for the most part has done well with staying away and if she buys something she has put it in the trunk for him to get himself from there.\nWell my D(ear)H has recently gotten sick with something none covid related it was an organ issue and had to have surgery. T-T outside of her usual hypochondria and attention seeking was pretty good. We can deal with the phone calls after all by zoning out and into something else and she only has hubby\u2019s number so he deals with all of it like a pro. Now since we are both disabled and Covid has made his current options nil DH has had to ask T-T for some help. She was always good about it and kept her distance. Mind you she was on a list for no covid patients at all while working per her requesting it as she didn\u2019t need or want the pay increase her hospital was offering. \nSo hubby was healing at home fine. Me and the kids were super happy to have him home. Well we noticed something was wrong. He had some swelling and redness around the incision but it could of been nothing because of what his surgery was. However to be safe DH called the hospital and they told him to come back in. Well it turns out the probably nothing was a pretty bad infection. He\u2019s been in the hospital for 3 days now with still no antibiotics for his infection or really answers for a plan of what to do. \nProblem is hubby left for the hospital the second time, before he and anyone else could go food shopping due to his injuries. So he in his drug induced state asked his mom to grab groceries for us and gave her the list he used for himself last time. T-T of course had to call him for everything, including which brand of there were options or if a dozen eggs meant a dozen or a dozen and a half. \nThe problem came when it came time for her to drop things off. She called hubby to let him know she would be an hour. Since it was so late I had ordered food for the kids. Problem came that she showed up 45 minutes early. So I had grabbed the food only to have her show up. I quickly told hubby to let her know I\u2019d be out soon via the bookface messenger. But I made plates for the kids so that they didn\u2019t try and help themselves. Once I got to my front door guess who was there. T-T. She informed me that the neighbors had let her in (no idea which ones) as our complex is locked from visitors. She then proceeded to just waltz in and talk to me about everything. I half-tuned her out and just focused on getting the food in, while trying to keep my 4 year old and 6 year old from rushing at her to give her hugs as they missed her. The 6 year old was easy as I just reminded her that there was a sickness going around and she decided her food was better. However I had to keep reminding my 4 year old not to get close. T-T didn\u2019t help by constantly telling her how she misses her and wanted a hug so bad. \nAs she finally pulled the last grocery from her cart T-T starts hacking up a lung and I of course look at her a bit scared. She laughed and told me she had been working with covid patients but I shouldn\u2019t worry since the last one was 3 days ago before her prep landed vacation had kicked in. That it was just her face mask making her cough.\nI probably looked like a deer in the headlights because suddenly she was in a rush to leave. \nAnd now I am just furious. She didn\u2019t tell us she had started working with covid patients, and now that she is she suddenly stops doing her routine with us to keep distance and instead came into my apartment. Took off her mask and coughed all over everything. FML\nIf any of us get Covid I am going to blame her. But now I am deep into a bottle of wine terrified that my husband who just had a major infection after a major surgery might get covid and I don\u2019t know how his body will handle that on top of all the other shit.\nTo top this off we are being billed 12k by the apartment because they think our kids activated the fire sprinkler in their room almost a year ago., we talked to a lawyer and we are pretty much stuck with the bill we could argue to lower it but there is a good chance we wouldn\u2019t lower it more than a lawyer would cost. And my husband has no insurance because of being unemployed and welfare giving us the run around for 2.5 years. \nThis week just sucks and T-T just had to risk my families health to top it all off.

I\u2019m indian he\u2019s black I knew this was gonna be an issue. Even before I started dating SO my sister and I would always point out her racism. It was a hard battle cuz she\u2019s an ATV (Always The Victim - coined by another Redditer on this sub, love the term) so she always cried about it but eventually some lessons stuck. She was so horrible at first. She assumed the kid in my SOs profile picture was his son and he had lied to me about it, the kid is his nephew who I have met several times at that point, she assumes he is from a bad family and poor, his family is obviously different culturally from mine but have always been kind and welcoming which is better than my family at the moment.\nGrowing up I saw so many of my elder cousin introduce their SOs to my mother before their parents cuz they knew she would be accepting, I always admired her for that, I wish I had my mother as an aunt not a mother cuz she did not extend that curtesy to me. I\u2019ve been with SO for 3 years and though it was slow at first through a lot of crying she has learned to check her some of her racism. I am lucky to have an awesome sister who will stand up for my SO when my mom says racist shit behind our backs and is slowly accepting my SO. Unfortunately it took 3 years to get there, so she missed out on 3 years of getting to know him. My own sister says she feels she doesn\u2019t really know SO because when I bring him around he spends so much time trying to impress my mother and father than just chilling and hanging with the kids.

She also asks him for favors, she\u2019s old. It\u2019s normally to explain bank notices, help fix some minor stuff, like a mini fountain and music box.\nThis has driven my mother crazy recently, she thinks if she asks more of my SO it proves that she is closer with him. She asked him to re-landscape their entire acre property, re-pave the area around the pool, and physically replace their fridge. I think he should do none of it but he says it\u2019s fine, mainly cuz I think he is really desperate to be \u201cpart of the family,\u201d but what really bothers me is how she speaks to him meow. She tried to joke around and kid with him, but that means insulting to her. She does this with everyone but she has a better relationship with everyone else. \nIn regards to quarantine I think she is really losing it. She really wants me to \u201ccome home\u201d despite the fact that I live with SO and there isn\u2019t realistically any more room for me in their house. She doesn\u2019t invite SO to stay just me. Grandma is quarantined to the basement as there are a lot of medical professionals in that house. Every 2 weeks SO and I\u2019ve been going over hanging out with my grandma through a weird half door from the garage to the basement. She\u2019s really lonely. My parents sister cousin SO and I will hang out for an hour or so in the backyard cuz we can stay far away from each other, not my grandma cuz \u201cshe doesn\u2019t feel comfortable in my parents space.\u201d \nUnfortunately my SO\u2019s aunt passed away recently. Aunt\u2019s son called one night and said he just couldn\u2019t cremate his mother alone. SO drove 6 hrs to be with him at the cremation and drove back. I\u2019ve been very strict about quarantine since then. While he was gone I bought groceries and we haven\u2019t left the apt since, I called my grandma and mom to tell them I won\u2019t see them for 2 weekends to let 14 days pass. Both were upset but my mom did not handle it well. She thinks I should leave SO and stay with her for 14 days even though she and my father are medical professionals and there are 5 people already on her house. After I said no she called SO stupid for going. I let it slide once. She called again asking if I was coming yesterday and she called him stupid again. I calmly told her that was rude, and she freaked out, she is just worried so she can be rude, I\u2019m rude for calling her out, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have a daughter like me, SO should understand that she talks to all family this way. True but she made it clear he\u2019s not family so she doesn\u2019t get to do that. I told her her reaction was stupid and hung up.\nLater on my father called to check on me, I explained that I will not be coming to see them anymore and why. Unfortunately my SO overheard the part where my mother called him stupid. He says it\u2019s fine but I know it hurts him. It\u2019s not like he thinks going across state lines to his aunts cremation was smart, but he had to be there for her son. He was the only one who could go as he is young healthy and isn\u2019t working. \nMy sister thinks I should take it as a good thing that it\u2019s a sign that she\u2019s \u201cjoking\u201d with SO but she said it in anger and I know stupid isn\u2019t really a huge insult but I feel very straw that\u2019s broke the camels back. She is amazing and compassionate person, I respected her a lot growing up cuz I saw how much she took care of and supported other people, I just wish SO got that same treatment from her.\n\n"}, {"title": "(Hello Doily) There's a light at the end of the tunnel and it's not a train!

We ended up having to let go of the nurse last week because HD became violent with her and she didn't have the training to deal with that. Her meds got adjusted after that and she's been more docile since then.\nMy DH is also on furlough for the next few weeks, so if we do move her soon, at least he will be here to deal with it.

Please excuse formatting and other mistakes I\u2019m a first time poster here. JNM has been married twice, first husband had a daughter my JYsis, second husband my father two kids GC brother and me. \nMy JYSis was given to her father to raise while my JNM married my father. After she divorced my JYdad I lived with her but eventually was given to my father to raise and my JYDad and very yes grandma raised me. \nI barely saw JNM growing up I remember a few times she dropped off the GC but she always drove away without seeing me. Yes she raised the GC not me or my sis.  I tried living with her when I was a teen but she was cold and I spent a lot of time next door at my JYGM house.  I eventually move in with JYGM and she passed away when I was 17.\nI had a son when I was 18 and a daughter when I was 24. I saw right away they were treated differently by my JNM and her family, I shut that down or so I thought. What I didn\u2019t know is when my son was with her he was given everything he wanted and allowed to do what he wanted. Eventually she was telling him I was a bad mother.\nI held my children accountable for there mistakes, never cruelly mostly toy jail or taking away electronics as consequences. They had responsibilities such as small chores, I taught them how to use a microwave or stove for cooking things like noodles or canned goods. My son started to pull away from family spending all his time in his room and having violent outbursts.\nMy son has a mood disorder and needs meds which he wasn\u2019t taking. He ran away to a friends house at 17 years old claiming abuse. No one laid a hand on him, called him names or talked down to him. JNM would visit him but not make the 20 min drive from where he was to our house to see me or my daughter.\nAll this has led to NC, my son refuses to talk me his dad or his sis. JNM is right there to pick up his mess when he\u2019s done wrong, he isn\u2019t responsible for his actions and is given whatever he wants or needs. I haven\u2019t spoke to JNM or my son in three years. JNM treats the boys like kings and the girls like trash. \nFor 37 years I chased after my JNM to love me, been to therapy a lot too. During a family therapy session she walked out because my therapist asked why she abandoned and neglected me. Mother walked out stating she doesn\u2019t have to take this. \nI miss my son terribly but not JNM side of the family. These things have been on my mind a lot recently and I thought I\u2019d get it all out.  I\u2019ve been searching social media for my son and I can\u2019t call my JNM because she won\u2019t answer, honestly I don\u2019t know her phone number anymore. I\u2019m disabled with chronic pain and that put a little extra chores with my kids on my bad days I struggled but was still a mom and did a majority of it.

BF and I live w MIL and her mom Ever since then my MIL has flown off the handle into a deep dark hole. She excessively spends money to where she\u2019s pawned some personal items of my boyfriends, hers, and passed FIL. Took months for her to get SOME items back. Last year in November I got my first car, and just recently I hit a deer and it\u2019s currently undriveable due to money issues. Since I haven\u2019t been driving my car I\u2019ve been forced to use hers to get where I need to go. Anytime I go somewhere, MIL or her mom asks me to pick up something from somewhere. MIL will wait DAYS until I go somewhere bf doesn\u2019t have license to tell me she needs me to pick up numerous things from certain stores. Lately it has gotten excessive & she never leaves the house unless she absolutely needs to (which is when I\u2019m not home or asleep). I do it willingly because I don\u2019t want to create tension since I live w her and use her car. I pay for gas when it\u2019s needed, I was going to start paying for oil changes but yanno, covid. \nAround a month or two ago she brought home a puppy. She didn\u2019t consult any of us besides her son (my bf) who was with her at the time. I\u2019m a little upset by that because none of us are mentally stable enough to take care of yet another dog (we already had 2). Shes let the puppy pee & poop all over the floor and then blames us 3 (bf, bf brother, me) because we \u201cdon\u2019t take her out enough\u201d. The house is starting to smell like poop & pee because a lot of the time it goes Un-cleaned even if she notices it or someone tells her. I feel like this dog isn\u2019t my responsibility because I didn\u2019t pay for it or have a say in getting it at all. She hasn\u2019t trained her at all and isn\u2019t feeding her the right foods, and lets her mom feed her human food. I\u2019ve tried training the dog basic commands, and to go outside not inside but it\u2019s not working since I\u2019m the only one who does it and I\u2019m basically never home or don\u2019t have time to between work, college, and basic errands.

I make sure I always put everything away, and throw away my trash. The house is CLUTTERED with things she\u2019s impulsively bought & had no room for, trash, and toys for my boyfriends cousins babies who we have for weeks at a time sometimes. My boyfriends brother is always exempt from cleaning and doing any type of house work or errands because he has ODD and will fly off his handle if someone tries to tell him what to do & he doesn\u2019t want to.

I told him, since we are finally set to move out, that his mother has seemed to become even more overbearing if that was at all possible! Not gonna lie, I got overwhelmed and started crying bc it had taken a lot for me to open up to him about it since typically he is defensive about any subject pertaining to his mother.

MIL stated, \"how would you ever make it on your own??\" Like I should be grateful DH hadn't made the move yet.\nMIL knows we will be moving soon and recently asked me \"are you sure you'll be able to handle being a SAHM??\" Uhhh of course! That's all I've ever wanted? Without her presence of course. \nShe continuously tails behind me whether I'm cooking or cleaning to \"fix\" things to her liking. Ughhh that's frustrating. Definitely won't be allowed in my new kitchen!\nHad a pity party crying and everything! to DH bc we didn't bring wood in or wash dishes at 9 at night and instead waited until the morning and tried to suggest that I give our LO too much fast food. All at the same time! Oooh I was mad, our LO does eat the occasional FF, but eats PLENTY of other healthy things like bananas and oranges. I don't think her deep fried potatoes and mushrooms are too far from fast food anyways. But whatever she calls \"healthy\" eye roll\nShe tried to accuse me of stealing ear rings when my ears aren't even pierced, I told DH, he confronted her about it, and she made up a BS lie about how \"the ghost\" must have taken them and she wasn't accusing me I just \"misunderstood\" her... Yeah, okay. \nShe enters our room every time we leave, I know this bc I've had to run back in plenty of times to catch her snooping through everything. But her house, she can do as she pleases right? Ugh, when we get our place, she better make herself comfortable in the living room! That's if I even decide to open the door. Lol. \nOver all, DH finally heard me!

(self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "145", "comments": "18", "content": "My sister (29f) and I (27f) have had a really terrible relationship our whole lives. I had a bunch of previous posts detailing all of that, but very recently, I recieved an email from her, in response to one I'd sent back in November. It was thoughtful and detailed, and said a lot of things neither of us have ever said. It was a final acknowledgment of past traumas that have shaped our relationship with each other. It was apology for the things we cannot change, and a promise to move forward with understanding and patience and kindness. We've spoken a lot since then, and it's been really nice. I'm seeing a whole other side of my sister that I didn't think I'd ever get to see. For the first time in my life, I feel like we're hearing each other, we're not hearing the filters our parents gave us for each other. Because of this, I have deleted my previous posts about her, as I know if she ever found them, the hurt would all come right back. \nNow my Mother. Well, the bitch bot will catch you up with details, but essentially, we're not speaking, as she called my husband fat, and then lost her mind when I confronted her, and resorted to a years old tactic of calling me angry and hurtful and telling me to grow up, and all that good wholesome mother daughter stuff. \nNow my Mother has this tried and true habit of running to my sister when her and I fight, and giving her the story the way my mom wants the world to see it. AKA I am awful and she made a harmless joke and now I'm being SO MEAN! This usually results in my sister getting involved and sticking up for PSH, berating me for being mean, and telling me we only have one mother, and that I need to grow up. \nExcept for this morning!! Sister and I were on the phone, she asked if I was mad at mom and I said yes. I thought, \"here we go again\" and sister told me PSH had told her that she made a joke about me gaining weight and that I flipped out at her. But sister said she was only asking because she doesn't believe PSH when she talks about me anymore. She also mentioned that my biggest stipulation for speaking again was that her relationship with PSH stay that way. Hers. I didn't want them to talk about me, or for sister to take everything PSH to heart about me. So she was trying to respect that. \nSo I told sister everything, told her about oldest sisters letter to her that was never acknowledged, the \"hundreds of phone calls\" that were literally only two drunken middle of the night calls to oldest sister. Sent her screenshots of the shit PSH was saying to me. Told her that she called husband fat, and the only thing anyone has ever asked of PSH is to be accountable for the shit she does and says, and to stop lying and deflecting. \nSister told me she feels like she's the only one who's never seen that side of PSH. She said that because of how bad things were with our sperm donor, she feels terrified of losing her relationship with our mom  too, which is why she always just goes along with PSHs crazy. She has never been on this end of the vitriol from her, PSH has only ever been the victim to her and it's hard for sister to not let her do that, because of her fear of losing her too. \nHonestly it makes so much sense. My sister was older, she remembers more of the toxicity from when my father was around, and so she saw my mother as a victim and stood up for her. Whereas I was daddy's little girl, it wasn't until I was 15 that I started seeing his true colors, and wasn't until I was 21 when I found out about the years of sexual abuse on my oldest sister. My mother in turn, praised my sister, everything she did was endless praise, anything she did wrong was something my mom stopped me from doing instead (sister threw massive parties and trashed the house, so I wasn't allowed to have a 16th birthday and could have one friend over, sister got the car and lost her license for having open alcohol in the vehicle at 18, I wasn't allowed to get my license until I'd moved out etc) so sister never got the anger and hatred from PSH, she was always out with friends or working etc. Where I was always grounded and stuck babysitting my little brother, I was always the one my mom targeted. \nI honestly feel bad for sister now. She feels like she's taking care of PSH emotionally, she knows she's lying, knows that PSH is the issue and it's not anyone else, but she has a lot of trauma from my dad that she hasn't let go of. So my mom is her safety net. She's willing to overlook all the shit, A. because it's not directed at her... Ever. And B. Because she's so desperate for some kind of normal parental relationship. \nI told her to drop the rope. She's not responsible for our moms feelings, and she's enabling the behaviour and allowing PSH to think she's in the right when we're trying so hard to get her to take responsibility for the hurt and damage she's caused. I'm seeing them both in a new light right now. It makes me 10 X angrier at PSH for causing such a huge rift between sister and I, by manipulating sister like this. So many of our differences are because sister always stuck up for her when she was so awful to me, and it's because my mom is a liar and knows sister has this trauma, so she exploits it. \nAnd she's doing it again now!

Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own. \nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking. \nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\nBallast!\nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .\nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\nNow you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder. \nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something! \nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.\nYou know what would be easier? If they all just chucked the bitch overboard.\n\u00a0\nThank you for letting me ramble. Thanks for the support, and advice, and humour.

Just holy shit. \ud83d\ude02 \nYesterday, my DS turned 4. We had a delightful day (6 weeks into quarantine, so that metric had shifted. \ud83d\ude02) and we made the best of it by surprising him after bedtime with a homemade cake, a big bowl of popcorn, and his first tour through The Empire Strikes Back, in his new Star Wars pj\u2019s, of course. Our little passed out cold with chocolate cake all over his face, curled up in my arms and cuddling a stuffed Wookiee. Perfection. \nManic Mollusk was nowhere in sight. No posts on social media that we are aware of, and nothing came in the mail. Until today. At least we got through his birthday without her?\nThere\u2019s a big box on my porch. It\u2019s clearly packed by her, with her handwriting on the outside of some recycled box. Could contain anything, especially Covid-19, as I don\u2019t trust her to take it seriously. I left it unopened on the porch and went to wash my hands instead. \nSo now sits the dread. It\u2019s always the same. What is in the box?  How hurtful will it be this time?  I\u2019ll dutifully open it, document the contents, photograph the notes, and pitch it all, just like all the others that I can\u2019t return or donate (can\u2019t donate anything locally right now anyway) but the fear is always present. She\u2019ll never stop trying to force herself into our lives until she\u2019s dead. Tonight, I will put on a mask and gloves, and open the box on my porch. Nothing she ever sends makes it across the threshold- she\u2019s not allowed in our home. But today? She\u2019s in my head again. And I hate her for it. \nSide note:  We are no contact. Cease and Desist is not a safe option for us- please don\u2019t recommend it. I will update this post after my son is safely in bed, having never seen the package.\nEdit:  GOLD!?  Wow. Thank you. I\u2019m so excited!\nUPDATE:\nY\u2019all, I can\u2019t fucking even. \nShe sent what has to be hundreds of dollars worth of toys. Toys that came with warranties she also purchased on amazon. Toys that are interactive and programmable. She knows that we don\u2019t gift this way, and it\u2019s absolutely yet another attempt to fucking upstage us. We gave our son one toy to open on his birthday, as well as a book, and a bunch of stickers. But the worst of it, is the note and the frame. \nShe sent a note card that is clearly written to the parents, instead of to the child. She talks about how she hand sewed these COVID-19 masks for the three of us, and she hopes that we will use them because it will help her feel better. She goes on to talk about this frame that she apparently had added to the box, and how I will have to decide whether or not DS is allowed to have it. I\u2019ll get to that in a second, but the first thing you need to know is that when I opened the box with the frame inside, she sent a framed photo of herself her new husband dressed as Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus together. I opened the back of the frame to see if she had written anything on the back of the photo?  She packed four different photos of herself into that fucking frame!  And if that\u2019s not enough?  \nShe specifically dead named me. In the note, she specifically writes that \u201cyou, Dead Name, can decide if DS can have the frame.\u201d  She completely removed my husband\u2019s agency or involvement in decision making regarding his fucking child, just so she could dead name me and let me know for sure that she\u2019d finally heard through the grapevine that I was changing my name. \nStill not enough?\nShe sent clothing for my son. Everything is specific to the college that my husband got his masters degree from, which also happens to be the local major college where we grew up. Seems innocent, right?  Well, like literally everything she pulls, it\u2019s all veiled in ways that are seem like something innocuous, so I come out looking like a crazy bitch. The reality is that her son, my much younger brother, has only worn clothing from this university for his entire freaking life. As soon as he could choose his own clothing, he has chosen to wear this university\u2019s mascot and colors. Manic Mollusk continues to try to dress my child like her son!!\nFuck this bitch.

In the end she wasn't the reason for the divorce but did play a major role in it.\nMind you this was happened about about 11 years ago. My SO (at the time) mother had only shown her evil side once. When we told her I was pregnant, she was visably upset and tried to force a \"Paid for\" abortion on me.  I told her no way that would be happening, I understood we were not in the best of situations but none the less we would make it. \nAnother thing you need to know is my MIL had been \"looking\" for a job for 3 years. She wasn't really but this is what she would tell her husband and my SFIL to shut him up.\nNow a few days before this incident my S/O had to start a 120 day \"Canadian fishing trip\" as we called it. He had a DWI charge he needed to go for. (sadly he still has a problem)  Like I said, we were not in the best of places. So I was newly preggo, no job and SO was on a trip. So I am a little scared but I have family and knew I would get a new job quickly. Alas just 4 days into his trip, I got a new job! I had called my MIL to tell her I had gotten the job! Yay and to top it off I was on my way to my 1st official baby appointment. I thought everything was great and she was happy for me. I go into my baby appointment, got to see my little teddy grahm, life was great! \nYa'll when I got out of the doctors appointment all hell broke loose. I had a missed call from my new job. They had only hired my hours before so I quickly called back. You are never going to believe what this crazy bitch did.\nShe called my new boss and told her not only was I pregnant (no I hadn't told them as it was still pretty early) but that I felt like she deserved the job more than I did. So she should get it.\nI was so embarressed!!!! I was worried that they would resend their offer, I mean who wants to hire a new girl thats pregnant and with a crazy family already causing issues?!?  Thank God my new boss was great. She laughed at the whole thing, told me to stay away from MIL and congratulated me on the baby. \nNow I proceeded to call my MIL, who of course didn't answer.  I flipped out on her answering machine. I explained what happened, so SFIL would understand why I then unleashed my terror on this lady. She was told she would have nothing to do with this pregnancy and she had better hope she ever hears from her son again also. She missed the first 3 years of my daughters life for this stunt. There were many many more to come once she did this. But this had to have been the worst.\nAs for my S/O, he backed me 100% Thankfully there was never any FOG with him. He was very upset and the next person to speak to her was me, almost 4 years later. \nThis is my first post so I hope I did okay!\nEDIT- Platinum on my first post?!? Ya'll are going to love me!

Meaning I blocked her on my phone and we're only conversing through email, and let me tell you, it has been great. I meant to meet up with her mid-March to talk through what happened and how it made me feel and what sort of boundaries I want to have in the future, but because of \\gestures at everything that's happening** we're unable to meet up right now. I've maintained that I don't want to talk on the phone before we have talked things through in person, so my decision on VLC has been very easy to uphold.\nThis period has not been unproblematic \u2013 quite early on JNM was being a drama queen about the whole thing. A positive side is that she finally started seeing a therapist again, but at the beginning she tried to make me take phone calls with her and the therapist, which I refused and told her that it's not all that dramatic. She then in turn in her usual guilt-trippy/manipulative way told me she has been neglecting herself (eating poorly and not exercising) because she has been so depressed about our relationship going to shit and how I'm going to leave her forever etc. (This is bad because of her underlying health condition, but it's in no way my fault and she shouldn't try to guilt me with it, which I told her, yay!)\nSince it looks like this social distancing situation will go on for quite a while, I've been recently contemplating that I could maybe loosen up to having one phone call a week where I would call JNM on a time I choose, because I'm feeling the FOG, knowing she'll be extra lonely during this time. However I was only contemplating this, mentioned about it to JYS (who JNM has been calling every day) and somehow JNM gets the same idea. JNM sent me an email dictating on which days she would be available, and that she would call me, because she needs to be positioned comfortably for a longer phone call. Which, while a legit reason because of her illness, made me feel really uncomfortable about having phone calls despite having contemplated it earlier. Suddenly I didn't have the control about them with her dictating everything, and it wasn't okay anymore. Because of the odd coincidence in timing I asked JYS if she told JNM about me contemplating phone calls, but JYS said she didn't and I believe her, so JNM must have otherwise decided on herself that it'd be time for a phone call. I told JYS I'm not comfortable with her calling me, and JYS told me how JNM has been complaining about not being able to call me and asking how I am etc, but that JYS understands very well and I should not give in etc.\nIn either case, I didn't answer the email, first because I wanted to know if JYS had talked about my idea and then because I forgot about it. Later that day JYS sent me a message and told me JNM had called her again and they had talked about JNM calling me, and JYS upheld my boundary against her! JYS said that I don't feel comfortable with phone calls until we have met in person, and JNM grudgingly accepted that, although she was still joking about how I \"could just come and visit her, hee-hee\". Not during social distancing I won't.\nNot sure if I should arrange a video call or something, but I'm not going to do anything until I feel comfortable. Social distancing is really helping me to figure out what boundaries I want to keep and how I'm going to do it, so at least something good is coming out of this.\n\n"}, {"title": "I blocked The Gnoll.

It happened naturally, no IUI or IVF, just 6 months of us not caring anymore and having sex while we felt like it (instead of every 2 days like all the doctors said). She is about 6 weeks pregnant so it still early.\nWe are overjoyed and extremely happy. We didn't want to tell the family yet but, because I slipped up while I was on the phone with my sister (who is also pregnant) and she kinda figured it out, the cat was out of the bag. So after that, we told my parents, my SIL and MIL/FIL.\nEveryone was happy, almost everyone cried. I am unsured about my dad because we didn't have video and he said he didn't, but I am pretty sure he did :).\nAnyways, the story happened today and let me tell you I am damn proud of my wife.\nWe were in the living room, I was playing video game and my wife was knitting something for the kid to be while she got a call from her mom. She put it on speaker and I turned the tv down so they could talk wihtout being bothered. I kinda half listened to the convo but I was still concentrated on the game so I didn't get all of it.\nI did however get the part where my wife was talking about how horrible it feels for both of us that I wont be allowed into the rooms for the echo/heartbeat thingy due to the covid epidemic since they only allow the mother in the appointment and no one else. She told her mom how unfair it was to rob me of those precious unique moments.\nMy MIL then answered with this gem : \"Who care about the dad ? the only ones that matter are the mother and the baby. He needs to grow up\"\nPretty sure my wife saw me flinched. I paused the game, put the controller down and let her know that I was going upstairs in our room (I laid down on the bed and cried).\nThis is the part that made me proud. You see, my wife doesn't like conflicts and really hates to have any sort of fight/argument with her mom. She wants to keep the peace because she love her familiy so much.\nWell, she fucking lost it. I didn't get all of it, but the gist of it was that I was the father of that child, he/she will be as much from me as from her and me not being able to have those moment and to cherish them later on is cruel. Also, didn't MIL think about what would happen and the appointment turns out the be a bad news? My wife would be stuck in that room alone, without me being able to support her.\nShe let it rip for about 10 minutes. I  do believe it was extremely liberating for her. I also heard the last part. If I don't get an apology, she can forget ever being part of that child's life.\nThis happened this morning. We haven't really talk about it yet, heck, we haven't really talk about anything for the rest of the day. I know how she is and she currently is processing it all. I am fully expecting a \"My mom is a fucking bitch\" during they day tomorrow and then the floodgate will open, and we will talk it out. \nAside from telling her that I love her and that I am proud of her, I wont have much to say thought.\nSo yeah, I would flag this as a success but since we cant flag it as success and ask for advice, I'll put it in update.\nIf you guys have any advices regarding the MIL, our situation or the shitstorm that might be coming, please, fire at will.\nThank you.\nPS : I am writing this at almost 1Am here because I am unable to sleep, wont able to reply to the comments for a good 7 hours. \nThank you.\n\n"}], [{"title": "COVID-19 Domestic Abuse Resources  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "348", "comments": "7", "content": "Shout out to /u/Ebbie45 for putting together this amazing list of resources for our community.

It involved aunts and uncles and of course, my mom and JNMIL, who had never met before that day. \nThe night was an unmitigated DISASTER. There were minor things, like jabs about my clothing (I had come straight from work to the party and apparently was showing too much boob) and about how the girls didn\u2019t all want to sit with JNMIL because they wanted to sit with my mom (HA). \nBut the two big ones occurred within about fifteen minutes of one another. \n\nAs most of you know by now, FIL is in a rehab hospital after a serious accident 4.5 months ago. He has a major TBI and struggles with emotional control, language/speech, and memory. During the party, when FH was handling one of the fames, JNMIL pulled my stepdaughter (one of the birthday girls) out of the party and SHOVED her cell phone against her ear. SD4 started SOBBING. At first I thought it was because she was pulled away from playing, but it eventually became clear that she was being forced to talk to her papa who could barely speak and she was so confused and upset. She later ran to us and cried \u201cwhere\u2019s Papa? I want papa. On the phone...where\u2019s papa?\u201d It was HORRIFYING y\u2019all. SD4 already has speech delays and behavioral issues and this was NOT the right choice for her emotional needs. We\u2019re both absolutely furious. \nShe found out we aren\u2019t going to the family thanksgiving by mistake (I didn\u2019t realize she was BEHIND ME when I answered a question to one of my friends) and went through the roof. Just oh my god LIVID. She then dragged FH ahead and demanded that we make an appearance at church the first Sunday that FIL is back \u201cas my birthday gift since you didn\u2019t bother to get me anything. You owe me this.\u201d We aren\u2019t going. She\u2019s going to go ballistic. \n\nI\u2019m still RAGING about the situation. We don\u2019t even know how to approach her about this. What do we even SAY about putting SD4 on the phone like that? Are you KIDDING ME?\nEdited to add: my mom was out of the room and it happened SO FAST no one could have stopped it.

While we're not moving BECAUSE of Soul Destroyer, it's a definite bonus.\n\u200b\nAnyway, last week we filed our taxes. DH makes some decent cake, I'm a college student, and I'm using GI benefits from my service, so we were pleasantly surprised when we found out we'd be getting back a mint. Granted, we have no kids or serious debt, we've each been on our own since we were 18 and have been together for 5 years, live on our own 60 miles away and own our cars, so to say that the money will be used well, especially in the pandemic, is an understatement. However, I made an error. While finishing up our filing, my sister called. While her relationship with SoulDestroyer has gotten better, it is in no way repaired. Anyway, we were talking about our individual taxes, the questions that one or both of us didn't understand, etc, when the amount of our returns were mentioned. I didn't think anything of it until I got a phone call from my sister to head me off.\nYou see, she had me on speakerphone, as she was outside at the time, but thought it was a private conversation. SoulDestroyer was standing at the top of the deck and off to the side, hidden but able to hear everything. While they got into it over the invasion of privacy, she texted me letting me know to expect a phone call. I swear to God, my sister must be fucking clairvoyant because, in less than an hour, my mother called me. After initial small talk where I basically grey rocked her with the exception of how my classes were going, she began.\n\u200b\nSD: So, I heard you're getting a pretty big payday this month, hunh?\nMD&S: What are you talking about?\nSD: Oh, just heard you were getting back $$$$ this year in your and DH's taxes. You know, if you're going to be saving up to buy a house, you should really put that in a savings account.\nMD&S: (not informing her that it's already been set up that way) I'll keep that in mind.\nSD: You know, if you need to, I'd be happy to help you and DH set up a budget that way you don't waste all of that money, or if you want to tuck some of it away, I'll hold it for you.\nMD&S: We already have a budget, and we each have our own banking accounts, but thanks anyway.\n(getting annoyed)SD: You don't have to be a bitch.\nMD&S: I'm not. However, I'm not a fucking idiot, and I'll be slurping on snowcones in hell before I give you access to my finances or to hold my money. You enjoy control too much, and if I gave you an ounce of it, even to hold a quarter for me, you'd want to know every single thing I did with our money before handing anything over, and swear up and down you were helping. That's not helping, that's being a gatekeeper so that you feel power over your family. I love you, I love Dad, but I flat out refuse to give either of you control to a single aspect of my life. You had that for 18 years, and look how fast I ran when I was able.\nSD: I am your mother! I deserve some fucking respect!\nMD&S: Respect is earned, not given because someone demands it.

Strap in guys, this is a wild ride in which I did THE THING that got me banned from any of her family functions. (Plus a few threats of dismemberment and bodily harm) \nA good friend of mine from university was getting married! They had been a couple since Junior year of college, through her 2 years in the peace corps and currently her return to this continent. 6 years in total. She had been to all manner of family functions and always came back with a strange story about how she thinks her MIL secretly hates her. But she being a very quiet and sweet person pushed those thoughts aside. \nPoint 1: She is vegetarian and jewish, husband is not. She was invited and went to Christmas dinner and figured she would just eat sides, as well she brought a vegetarian casserole. MIL, after knowing her for THREE years, and being told by husband a few weeks before about not to forget friend doesn't eat meat...proceeded to put meat in every dish. Friend drank water and ate her casserole the whole night while MIL cried to everyone that friend was so rude for not eating her cooking. \nAnyway, back to the story. A few friends and I were asked to be in the wedding. Friend has a HUGE family and so this was not going to be a small affair. Neither of them is particularly religious, but friend said it was would be nice to be married under a hoopa. (Think an arbor but 4 poles and covered with a white cloth and lots of flowers) Husband said he could care less, and told her to go and rent one for the wedding. \nI was at the bridal shower when MIL found out the \"pretty canopy\" was actually a hoopa. She almost lost her shit in front of a bunch of people, but managed to compose herself and laugh angrily that \"if the jews were being represented so would the catholics.\" In my head I heard a record screech, guys... they aren't catholic. \nSo after much fighting, a lot of screaming, crying, threatening to pull money (which is funny because she contributed nothing), MIL lost. The boot was firmly placed, and nothing was moving it. Hoopa yes, catholic priest no. \nThings got stupid quiet, my friend texts me the night before the wedding that she has a bad feeling. I tell her it's probably just nerves, she is getting married and this is a big deal! Oh how wrong I was. \nWe all show up, get our hair and makeup done. Slip into our bridesmaid dresses and hang out waiting for the bride to be finished with her hair. She makes a comment saying she hadn't seen MIL all day and that she skipped her hair and makeup appointment. We all side eyed each other, took a few sips of wine and hoped the eerie feeling would go away. \n30 minutes later as we are helping the bride into her dress; guess who shows up. If you guessed MIL, you win a cookie! Flushed from coming up the stairs, (she is not a light woman) in full hair and makeup...and a white dress. Not ivory, not cream, full snow-fucking-white. The dress was clearly a wedding dress; it was even from David's Bridal (which she would later shout at me). Floor length satin with a sweet heart beaded top, a bit of a train and off white lace on the bottom. The dress was even tailored to her, this has been a long con she has orchestrated. \nThe bride burst into tears and aunts and friends ushered MIL out. We did our best to console the bride, touched up her makeup, and I made her a promise that the dress would never be seen in a photo. She looked me dead in the eye and nodded. The game was on. \nThe venue only supplied white wine and champagne for the wedding party. But I grabbed my purse and ran down into the reception area and managed to flag an attendant by the bar and bribe him with a cool 20$ to give me a bottle of red early. I cracked the baby open, filled a solo cup to the brim with it and stalked outside. After a few swigs from the bottle for courage, I went over to where everyone was getting ready to take photos. \nWith one last hard stare at my friend, I got her nod of approval. I pulled out my phone, held it in front of my face like I was reading a text and walked straight into MIL. I poured the entire cup of red wine down the front of her dress, jumped back and gasped. \nThe look on her face was murderous. She screamed, yelled, threatened, and promised she would sue me. People had to hold her back because she wanted to fight me. Eventually she switched from screaming to sobbing and sank to the ground and threw a tantrum on the floor. Everyone moved back and just let her go at it and walked away to go take photos. It was surreal, as if everyone just hit their limit and noped out from around her. The 12 year old flower girl whipped out her phone and snapped a few photos much to our amusement. \nThis is already super long, but I will say that MIL went home and changed (only 20 min from venue) into a nice dark green too small and low cut dress. Because of this she missed all of the photos. Wedding was beautiful; I got death glares from everyone she told that I attacked her with wine. No fucks were given as I drank and danced with friends. Bride thanked me in secret and 3 months later took me to the spa for a day of pampering. But I am officially \"that ISIS cunt\" to MIL, and I'll take it with pride. \nEDIT: You guys are awesome! Someone gave me gold?! WINE FOR ALL! \nIn all seriousness, I'm glad you all enjoyed this story. I am not a super hero but I am a woman who has been kicked around a lot due to ethnicity by this MIL and had zero fucks left to give. Lone Ranger style my fight or flight reaction is permanently stuck on fight. \nThe couple has been NC for the last year and half since the wedding. \nEdit.2: HOLY WAFFLES THIS BLEW UP\nEdit.3: RIP my inbox! I'm trying to grant you all your cookies! Also, I'm happy to explain the situation but the rude \"YOU R LIEING\" messages aren't appreciated.

MIL is obsessed with our baby and keeps coming up with excuses to stop by, which DH keeps shutting down. \nMy MIL found out I had taken my daughter for a walk in our neighborhood at the same time she was planning on stopping by our house, unannounced and unwelcome, to drop off some unwanted stuff (from her shopping addiction and proof that she's not staying home). DH innocently thought she wouldn't stop if baby and I weren't there. So she drove around until she found us, and jumped out of her car before I could even react. She was in our faces and practically crying because she missed my daughter so much, despite DH sending her nearly daily pictures and/or video. \nI am so over this woman. She normally texts/calls me 2-3 times a year and I see her at major holidays and a few times in between. Our relationship is polite at best. She is pushy and overbearing. I am shy and introverted. She now calls and texts me every single fucking day. How does anyone think it's ok to change normal communication that drastically? I feel like a fucking vessel for her do-over baby (\"this is the baby of my baby, so she's basically my baby.\") She says nice, superficial things to me (\"Thank you for being a good mom to LO.\" LOL you're welcome?! It's totally all for you, MIL....). \nI sent her a text after the stalking, \"I didn't appreciate being ambushed today, that was not ok.\" Her response, a day later: \"I find this text extremely hurtful and mean...im sorry i startled you yesterday....but putting it this way in a text is rude and not ok with me...I would never speak to you in such a demeaning and dis-respectful way...\"  LMAO How was my text demeaning and disrespectful?? \nYou would never speak to me that way MIL, but you would....sneak into my back yard and porch, while I'm at work, to clean and decorate for a family party at my house after I declined your offer. Putting my inferior outdoor furniture in my basement and replacing it with your own. Or inviting DH's younger cousin's boyfriend to our wedding, a week before the wedding after you were told no and the final head count was already given to the caterer, because you NEEDED to meet him - apparently there was no other option to meet your niece's boyfriend than at my wedding. You would never speak to me that way, but you would forcefully push diet pills on me as a teenager, in front of DH (then boyfriend), saying \"Don't you ever want to be not fat?!\" Or go through our stuff and set up my nursery for my first child while I'm at a prenatal appointment and DH was distracted with his dad. Those are just a few highlights. \nBut you're right MIL, apparently I'm just a huge bitch. Maybe you should stop contacting me so I don't hurt your feelings anymore. \nAlso relevant: DH was pissed and had it out with her on the phone after I got home from the walk. She claims she did nothing wrong because she doesn't have the virus (even though she's been sick for weeks).\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the advice & reassurance that I wasn't overreacting. I didn't back down, and while I don't know if she actually learned anything, she apologized. I plan on going back to letting DH handle all communication with her. I'm still pissed but happy that I actually called her out on her bullshit. Before apologizing, she doubled down on calling me mean & saying that I must hate her, boo hoo hoo. I powered through, she apologized, and I reiterated that DH & I are the law when it comes to our daughter. I'm sure this isn't the end of her shitty behavior, but maybe we can make some progress movingforward. If not, we'll go NC. \nAlso, she doesn't have a key to our house.

Both of our parents decided to come.\nAfter 10 hours the birth was more hard them the expected, I was tired, scared, literally crying. So I gave up and asked my husband to call my mom, I just fell like I needed her there. Not much later the baby was born. I was holding my mom's hand so hard that one of her fingers broke.\nIn the other day when she came visit me and the baby she was pretty cold with me but I was too happy to give attention to it. But after that I noticed I was receiving the cold treatment in every single family event. When I asked what was the problem she simple said \"nothing\" or \"I don't know what you are talking about\".\nDuring this time for obvious reasons I am not permitting any visitors, but I offered my MIL TO Facetime with her so she can see the baby, this have been working fine, until yesterday. My mom is staying with us, my father is a first responder and was afraid of infect my mom, she have asthma. I was bathing and asked my mom to accept the call when she call, when I was out of the bath my mom was showing the baby and everything was fine, my mom said \"look (my name) finished\" and pointed the camera to me, I waived for her she disconnected the call, I sent a message asking if she wanted to call again, she sent me \"no, that was enough\".

You have treated me so bad because I didn't let you in while I was giving birth? By the love of God. I was vulnerable, in pain, and naked, I didn't wanted no one in there, she only entered because I was scared and really needed her!\nMIL - I was there for all my grandchildren birth, you make me break the tradition\nMe - I was in pain and trying to push a baby out of my body! You know what I am tired of this, you can get over this or pass the rest of your life with that crap attitude.\nMy husband told me that she really was in the room in all the others deliveries, and since I called my mom it would be a nice gesture permit her to get in too. But I still had the right to choose that.\nEdit for the original\n1. She have 2 daughters and 1 other DIL.\n2. I talked to the other DIL and she told me she forced her entry in the delivery room. I think she didn't it to me because my father was there and he is a police officer\n3. I talked to my husband, I asked if my dad could be in the room if he take a vasectomy. He is now on my side.\n4.

I very much did not want to argue.  I was a doormat).\nThe first time I had a birthday after we met she bought me an Easter egg as a gift.  It was one that had been in her cupboard since the year before and was out of date.  Ex and I went out for the evening and he brought her along to our romantic dinner because \"she wants to celebrate your birthday and get to know you better\".

People here are put into a vulnerable position sharing such personal stuff and having it stolen and pop up elsewhere feels really shitty. Someone doing that to me made me concerned for my anonymity and safety of my family as well. Don't do that to us here, please. \nAnyway, DH and I have been taking full advantage of being non-essential employees. We finished our basement remodel and now have a fully functioning game room! We also have been decorating the nursery too which I've found to be very relaxing. I was pretty disappointed once I realized that I wouldn't get to have a baby shower, but I'm trying to put that at the back of my mind. I've stressed enough over the last month to last me a lifetime. But baby is healthy and growing great so that always manages to make me happy. All the dogs are good too, we kept a close eye to see if they had any behavioral changes and they are back to business as usual. They were weird around the gate area for the first week but are fine now. At the advice of someone here we invited friends over to help dig up the soil that her blood soaked into and put it into a huge bonfire. Then we made party and it was great. The next day my mother, oh my amazing mother, had an Elder from our reservation come and lead my family and I in a healing circle in our yard. It was much needed and the effects of which DH and I still feel. I was so worried about how I would feel safe here ever again without feeling scared and I believe that ceremony made all the difference. We also decided to go to therapy to work through this. We as a couple are strong but this attack did leave us feeling pretty broken as future parents. We're taking all of this one day at a time and continuing therapy (virtually rn) for as long as needed. \nWe sent a C&D to CIL because she called us trying to apologize. She was the one who gave our personal info, and she also is being charged criminally. We reviewed more of our camera footage and found she had been to our place another time, right before the Valentine's day flowers. While we were both at work she had climbed over our gate, walked around the side of the house, and tried jiggling the door on the side of our garage to see if we regularly locked it. Gathering info for my MIL. She is blocked on every possible avenue and as of now, her brother and parents aren't holding any ill will towards us for reporting her. I hope that remains the case because her brother and DH have really grown close.\nMIL is still in jail right now. --ETA: In my last post I had stated she was bailed out. All the crazy confusion during that time mixed with our panic kicked my pregnancy brain into low gear. She didn't end up getting bailed out by her mother because she doesn't control her own banking anymore due to her dementia. I hastily put that she was bailed out in my confusion and didn't even remember until another user asked about that. Sorry for the confusion, more details are clear to us now that a few weeks have passed since the incident.-- So currently, nobody is willing to pay her bond which I am incredibly thankful for. She plead not guilty to all the charges, most of which are felony charges, so we will be going to trial. We are also filing against her in civil court. We got a restraining order granted just in case she does somehow get released. I'm not willing, at least for now, to go into much more detail about potential charges or anything like that. My community has really been amazing in helping maintain my privacy in all this and I am forever grateful to my neighbors and our police department. Because she was so stupid as to document a lot of her ideas and info she got from CIL there are heapes of evidence against her. Couple that with her shit health and that leads to my only comforting thought in all this: she's going to die in prison. \nYou know what though? She was right about one thing....how lucky I am. I AM INCREDIBLY LUCKY. I'm lucky I'm alive. I'm lucky my baby is okay. I'm lucky to have a partner who isn't enmeshed with a monster. I'm lucky to have such amazing dogs. I'm lucky that my family and friends have done everything possible for me to feel comfortable at home again. I'm lucky I was raised to always trust my gut instinct. And most of all I'm lucky my husband is by my side in all this. I don't have to worry about him defending anyone or justifying the actions of anybody besides our family. If I didn't already have one cooking I'd let him put a baby in me all over again because he's exactly what a good father should be.

Let me know how your first day went?  \nThis is a hard message to write, but one that I feel needs to be sent.  \nI know you have made huge sacrifices for me, and only want what\u2019s best, but some of the things you have said to [girlfriend] in the past have been less than kind. Please know that [girlfriend], our babies and I are indivisible. Anything you say to one of us, you say to all four of us. We are a family and, as man of the house, it is my role to protect us from anyone who wishes us harm. That, I\u2019m afraid, does include you. We are willing to forgive, but cannot excuse any further attacks on [girlfriend]. This will be my final word on that. We all want you to continue to be part of our lives, but I must insist that no further negative comments are made toward us for the sake of my children, my girlfriend and myself.  \nI have a meeting in Richmond Friday afternoon, do you want to meet up for dinner after I get off work? Let me know.\n\nI hope this does the trick. Referring to myself as \"man of the house\" sounded really fucking weird, I have to admit, but I feel it gets the point across and my girlfriend was keen on including it.\nWish me luck, we'll see how this goes.\n\u200b\nEdit: as expected, I didn't get a positive response. Mum ignored my message but went crying to my sister, who called me to call me a wanker for bulling mum. Mum hasn't reached out and I'll be damned if I make the first move. Ultimately the text achieved what I wanted it to - we're being left alone, with no intrusive calls, texts or visits, so I'm going to chalk this one up as a win. \n\n"}, {"title": "A general update and Giada is still a PITA  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "2032", "comments": "147", "content": "Hey all. It's been a while. Sorry to be back again, but I'm lost. After I last posted here, I took a much needed mental health break, upped my therapy appointments and antidepressants, and stayed away from any kind of negativity in my life. I started seriously looking at my health and began swimming several times a week once my medical team gave the go head. I've dropped 50 pounds since December. I also started looking into schooling and careers. I was hired as a receptionist and spoke to a local university that offers a MS in a career I'd love. Best of all, I was Giada free for months. \nThen the pandemic hit. My job was non-essential and I was let go. My finances took a hit. My gym closed. I lost my stress relief/exercise outlet. My therapy office is closed until 4/1. I am receiving no mental health care. And I guess Giada has gotten bored with the quarantine because the letters, emails, and calls have started again. Some letters/emails are blank. Some have references David and Goliath. Some mention demons. Some just say it's my fault her son died. The calls come at all hours of the day and night from all different numbers. No one ever says anything. Once someone screamed into the line. No words. Just an ear piercing scream.\nI was so close to feeling happy and hopeful. I know I should try to stay positive and look at my blessings. I have a roof over my head, a couple of days worth of food in my freezer, a cat that is my world, a SO who loves me even if he is quarantined in another country. I have so much more than so many others but I still feel like shit. And I feel like shit that I feel like shit because others have it so much worse. I don't know how to navigate all this and I am terrified of going back to that place where I was terrified of Giada and her monkeys every day.\nI do want the thank everyone who checked up on me while I was gone.

TLC needed because we are still trying to process everything.\nToday was a draining day.\nAV texted me a few times, including a message where she told me how marriage works and I'm alienating my husband from them. She dropped off some laundry for DH and was sobbing to him about how much she misses him and our daughter. I was starting my homework at this time and my eyes couldn't have rolled back farther in my head.\nNow, today our mayor announced due to COVID-19, our city has a stay at home order going into effect on Thursday. No social calls. Husband and I are both considered essential workers, so aside from work, we've been doing everything we can to minimize the risk of exposing DD. This is important for later.\nIt's a few hours later, and I'm still working in the kitchen. DH and DD were napping in the back bedroom. I hear the doorbell ring, but I don't answer because who wears pants at home when they're not expecting anyone? Then again. Followed by knocking. Repeat for about 10 minutes. I figured it was some Jehovah's Witnesses since I remember driving past their church and it was full of cars the other day and it's the end of the world. Oh, how I was wrong. At one point, the bell rang consistently for a minute, the chime not evening having a chance to finish. Then I hear the key turn.\nAttention Vampire and FIL (who, by the way, isn't allowed over here until DD gets her 6 month vaccines) step in and call for my husband. I'm annoyed at this point, so I snap at them that he's asleep. FIL then says he's going to call the cops to conduct a wellness check because of course that's the rational thing to do when your son is taking a nap. \nI call across the house for him and go wake him, telling him his parents threatened to call the cops. He rubs is eyes and says that he hopes they do. I stay in the room with DD as they're grilling DH, telling him to be a man and asking if I abuse him and if he's safe. He says yes and they demand to speak to me as well. I didn't want to go out there, but DH asked me to at least tell his dad to go because he invited himself in and refused to get his whooping cough booster. I go out there and they start to grill me, saying I'm alienating my husband and why is my sister allowed over? I confirmed with my husband that yes, his phone works, and that yes, his car is operational, and yes, his license and insurance are valid. I told them I'm not keeping him away and that he's free to visit whenever he pleases. The fact his dad hasn't seen DH in a while is on my husband. As for my sister, she has been over 3 times since DD has been born, whereas AV comes over at least once per week (when I'm not home). AV asked what they did that was so horrible, and I mentioned the lies, the gaslighting attempts, not respecting boundaries or our home, moving my medication while I was pregnant. So many little things and she denied each one. \nEverything took about an hour, and unfortunately the cops weren't actually called. After they left, we sat in the nursery and watched DD and tried to comprehend what in God's name just happened and why they snapped like that. Tomorrow we're calling the sheriff's office to figure out how to get a no trespass order with all government buildings being closed to the public. We're also going to call around for a locksmith who isn't reduced to emergency lockouts. \nI'm hurt that they would even entertain the idea of me being abusive toward my husband. I stayed fairly calm during this, but I just want to cry and maybe break a plate. Instead I'm about to brush my teeth and go to bed. Hopefully the morning brings me some clarity.\nETA: I forgot why I mentioned the stay at home order. As a precautionary measure, many essential businesses have issued travel papers for their essential employees if our city has to go a step or two further. FIL and AV are also essential. We all have travel papers for if we're not going to the grocery store, pharmacy, nature trails, or to seek medical attention. FIL said he'd get the booster because he hasn't seen DD. I said that's great, but the stay at home order also forbids social visits. He said they would use their travel papers to bypass that. Uh, no. Breaking the order comes with a $1000 fine and up to 180 days in jail. Besides, they both work in positions with high risk for community spread. I don't care for myself, but our baby barely has an immune system.\nEdit #2: thank you, kind stranger, for the gold!

I\u2019m 17, almost 18 (I\u2019ll be 18 April 10th) and a little over a month ago I found out that I\u2019m pregnant. When I first found out I was terrified, literally cried because I just wasn\u2019t sure I could do this. I told my mom, and she was really supportive. Disappointed, sure, but supportive and we talked for hours, and weighed all the options and I decided that I want to keep my baby. Shortly after I told her, I told him, and he was pretty scared, but also pretty excited to be a dad.. We understand how difficult it will be and that I\u2019ll have to put my life on hold for a bit, but I\u2019m okay with that because I will go to college and still accomplish all my dreams, my baby will just be a part of them now. So when I got full support from him, and from my family it kind of felt like a breath of fresh air. \nHim and I decided that we had to tell his parents obviously , which we were both extremely nervous about because his family is a lot more \u201cget married, and then have kids when you\u2019re 30\u201d which is fine, but that clearly went out the window. Not to mention, his mom hasn\u2019t been a big fan of me for the last year of our relationship. We\u2019ve been together for a year and 9 months, and for the first few months his mom seemed really nice. But it was like the longer we were together, the more she hated me. When he would bring me to the occasional family holiday with them, his mom would roll her eyes, make little comments about how it looked like I gained a little weight, or about how I was breaking out. Or about how much \u201ccleavage\u201d my dress was showing. Nobody else in his family treated me like that. His dad and sister love me, his grandparents love when he brings me over, I have never had a run in with any of them. It\u2019s just like, his mom almost feels threatened that I\u2019m trying to \u201csteal him from her\u201d or something. He admits that his mom is pretty overbearing and doesn\u2019t really want him to grow up. But the death glares and shady comments have been a bit much. \nWhen we told them though, his dad was pretty excited and his mom acted as if she was as well. Obviously they had some concerns, but we talked them through and everything seemed okay. When dinner was over though, and my boyfriend went to go warm up his car, his mom pulled me into the kitchen and told me that i NEED to get an abortion. She was being very aggressive and was like gripping my arm, in my face telling me she doesn\u2019t want me with her son, and that if I don\u2019t abort this baby she was going to cut her own son off. I asked why she felt I needed to get one, and told her I refused, and she just kept saying she doesn\u2019t like me for her son, and that she doesn\u2019t want him tied to me. It hurt, a lot hearing that. But on the ride back to my house, he just kept going on and on about how happy he was that his parents were happy for us. And I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him that his mom did that. It makes me nervous, because I know that if I tell him he\u2019s going to be pissed and confront his mom. Which sounds like a good thing in theory, but he\u2019s employed through his dad. His dad owns a construction company, and he works for him making pretty good money. That money is how he afford his apartment and his car insurance and his groceries. And if he confronts her, and she really does cut him off, she\u2019ll sure enough do some whispering in his dad\u2019s ear and get him fired. Which will leave us in an even tougher position. We both have jobs, and have quite a bit in savings, but I absolutely cannot do it alone, financially or in the physical and emotional sense. I\u2019ve done some looking into other construction jobs in case I do tell him, but none of them pay NEARLY as well as his current job pays him. And it could completely ruin him getting his dad\u2019s company someday, and I don\u2019t wanna fuck up his family and his life like that. \nHowever, for the last WEEK (literally every single day, several times a day) his mom has been sending constant harassing messages. Telling me once again that I NEED the abortion, that I\u2019m not right for her son, that I\u2019m a whore and I\u2019m ruining his life, telling me she\u2019ll drive me to the abortion clinic and pay for it all. It doesn\u2019t stop, I try to reason with her, tell her at least not to cut her son off but that I won\u2019t come around anymore. But she is set on me getting an abortion and getting out of his life. I didn\u2019t ask his parents for ANYTHING, I never would. I didn\u2019t expect them to offer up babysitting or money or anything, because like I said, I figured his parents wouldn\u2019t be too happy about it. It\u2019s not even the financial aspect or anything else she\u2019s worried about. She just doesn\u2019t want me to have a baby with him. There\u2019s really no clean way out of this, and I am terrified that I\u2019m gonna dig us into a hole that we can\u2019t get out of. I refuse to get the abortion just to please his mom. It pisses me off that she\u2019s going behind his back like this, giving me an ultimatum and telling me I\u2019m responsible for whatever happens. But I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel trapped. I know having a baby right now isn\u2019t gonna be an easy thing in the SLIGHTEST, but his mom is just making it so much harder on us.\n\n"}], [{"title": "Update to JNMother finally suing me.

My lawyer/family friend contacted a judge from the area I live and showed her the lawsuit my mother sent overseas to us. \n.\nThough, in this new country, a parent can also sue their children for support but not in a way my mother thought of. The judge looked at the lawsuit and took in the abusive texts, plus history, into consideration and decided that - in simpler terms - my mother was being utterly ridiculous. \n.\nI won't say much of what the judge decided but it all comes down to this: \nMother is not disabled and still works to earn more money that I do. She has other adults that can help out but would not make them do it. I have 2 small children and a significant less income than what my mother can get monthly. Therefore, it is not a negotiation for her to be demanding these things from me. She cannot do it. Plus, I have already changed my citizenship and that ruined her chances. \n.\nMother's request of an established contact with my children is also denied. \nThe judge saw everything and it doesn't take Einstein to know that she has no best interest of these children in her heart. Plus the history of physical abuse and sexual abuse I went through growing up with the family, the judge was appalled that she dared/had the audacity to make these demands.\n.\nSo far, so good. \nOther than that, my mother's flying monkeys have been ringing the phone nonstop. \nIt's fine though. Their calls go through to voicemail and it is them paying for the phone bills (overseas calls ain't cheap lol) so yeah, that's on their part. \n.\nThat's all. Thank you for everyone's advice. The lawyer sent the judge's written statement back to my mother's lawyer so we shall see.\nHer lawyer contacted back btw. Updates below I guess. \n.\nEdit: What I forgot to mention was that this happened a couple of days ago and the letter was also sent through the email. Therefore, my lawyer contacted me with some interesting thoughts. \n\nMy mother claimed I went no contact to avoid my responsibility towards her and other 5 adults, not due to the abuses that didn't happen. \nShe claimed, now this is beyond wild, that my partner has 'stockholm syndrome' me into believing that she's the worst person on earth. (Even the judge thought she was the worst person on earth. And they never met!)\nThe money that I earn legally belongs to her, in her own words, as she put me through schools, gave me food, and gave me shelter. \nShe was put up with my abuse towards her since I was a child. She's therefore more of a victim than I was. \n\nEtc, etc. \nThere are more crap to mention but for now, these are the most outrageous things she came up with to justify her lawsuit. \nCrazy does speak crazy :/\n\n"}, {"title": "(UPDATE) My life is so much calmer without Pig Farmer in it  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "1999", "comments": "85", "content": "This isn't a new story, just an observation I've made over the last few weeks. \nWe finally got her to sign for the C&D and everything has been so.... stinking.... quiet..... ever since. \nY'all, I knew she was stressing me out, but I didn't realize how much time I was devoting to managing her until she was truly 6 months in the rearview. \nIt really hit me when DH had to go out of town for a couple of weeks.

Some of the shit she did was mildly helpful, to be fair, such as taking kids to their games if the schedules conflicted, but mostly she was just up my ass 24/7. I couldn't sneeze without getting snot on PF if DH was out of town. She'd show up at games. She'd show up with meals. She'd invite the kids to do fun activities without asking me, knowing I was tired and worn down and would agree just to not have to deal with their little tears of disappointment. \nTo keep this from happening, I would delay her finding out DH was gone as long as humanly possible. Activities I engaged in to keep PF in the dark included driving DH 45 min to work at 4 am with 3 kids in tow (and driving home after dropping him off, so an hour and thirty in unnecessary commute) so that she wouldn't realize a car was missing when she casually stalked our house in the evenings. Yes, you read that right, I'd drive him to work so his mother wouldn't notice his truck wasn't home when she stalked us at night. Because she drove past our house constantly despite it being on a dead end street convenient to absolutely nowhere and not on anyone's way anywhere. \nI was absolutely dreading it when DH left town for work for the first time since moving. After all, him being gone has always created so many headaches. Except this time it was fine - and it took me a few days to pinpoint that the reason it was fine this time was because PF was gone. Without needy ass PF to trip over every time I took a step, I was fine being alone with 3 kids. Which seems backwards since you'd think the presence of a second adult would be more helpful than frustrating, but its different when that \"adult\" is PF. \nAnd speaking of being calmer...  did I mention that PF cannot cope with any kind of disaster?\nSnow? She faked a heart attack rather than drive in it. Severe storms? Oh, the terror! The horror! A tree... might fall... on your house! And kill you all! Better move out and in with PF! Tornadoes- Oooooooh, Nonadoes! Wild fires 3 counties over? She can't breathe! Floods? She cannnnnnnn't swim!!!! \nSeriously, every 'disaster' that made the news instantly became a personal trial of Pig Farmer's and she promptly blew it waaaaay the fuck out of proportion. She'd panic call us dozens of times a day to make sure we were surviving the disaster at hand. My favorite was always her panic over snow - considering DH normally drives big pickup trucks and we never got more than about 4 inches and usually much less than 4 inches - so we were never,  ever stuck, not even once, by said snow. \nI don't even want to talk about the time we lost power for 4 days thanks to severe storms. We were fine, if a bit bored. It was like camping except with a house. Basically we opened all the windows, iced down the deep freezer like a giant cooler and grilled out for 4 days straight. PF, however, nearly died. Not sure how she nearly died because the entire situation was mostly annoying and she doesn't have any medical conditions that required power, but she almost died and when her phone did die, boom, she was dying on our doorstep. Things were not any better/worse at our house versus hers, but she needed to \"be with family\" during such terrifying times. \nDH mentioned to me yesterday how badly his mother was likely taking the current disaster and how nice it was not to have to add her list of panicky concerns to our own actual problems. And you know what? He's 100% right. It's so freaking quiet without her here to turn all our molehills into mountains. Am I able to stay calm and clearheaded without someone panicking in my ear 24/7? Why yes, yes I am.\nIt's not just the major issues that went away when we went NC. All the annoying, petty, day to day bullshit disappears as well and man, it's nice. I have no regrets about going NC whatsoever.\n\n"}, {"title": "Fucking Linda wants partial custody and visitation with hypothetical grandchildren  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "3418", "comments": "357", "content": "TW: Fucking Linda story. You can't get more specific than that, she's just that fucking horrible. This one isn't so bad but Fucking Linda is known to drive pacificts to wall-punching rages, and the emotionally jaded weep. \nHello my lovelies, I am taking a break from the utter shit modding I do (honestly it's mostly posting flair for people on mobile, approving or dissaproving comments filtered by auto mod, and being a horrible slacker. I am, however, in my LAST SEMESTER at college, working full time, managing a divorce in my marriage, and currently- SICK AS A DOG. I got tested and its influenza A, not corona, but the 103 degree fever and inability to do anything more strenuous than cough and pee at the same time is just as shitty, regardless of the source of infection. This is a good visual representation of my life right now. However, this leads to a whopper of an email from Fucking Linda and everyone's favorite way for Bippy to post- fucked up on Nyquil!\nThe best part is at the end of this long ass letter. Sorry, not sorry.\nFor those unfamiliar with the Fucking Linda saga (check the Bot for more)- she's Satan's least favorite concubine, which is why she still roams the earth. She's my narcissistic, undiagnosed borderline personality disorder, massively unplesant tantruming elderly child of an egg donor. She's an emotional and financial vampire, beat me severely enough that my bones have a network of scars along them and my spine had permanent damage before I was 13, stole thousands from me, forced me into prostitution as a child while my Dad was in the hospital fighting for his life because she was \"too stressed\" to get a job, and is still completely and utterly confused as to why I've gone no contact for the last four blissful years. \nShe a bitch. K?\nSo my AwesomeBrother, the GC who gets it, got a whopper of an email from her. He replied with kindness and grace (basically he said HELL NO but really nicely), but I wanted to copy/paste enough of this thing to show exactly what the fuck I am dealing with, still, from the mouth of the she-viper herself. Fuck her privacy, BTW, if she wanted me to respect the privacy of her emails she shouldn't have forced me to suck dick for money at 15 years old. \n\u200b\n\nDear (AwesomeBrother):\nI don't want to be stranded in tiny, cold, blue-collar Kenosha. \n\nGood. Stay out of my badass state of cheese and pork products. #WisconsinPride I have so far loved blue collar Milwuakee, and Fucking Linda's obsession with being 'better' than blue collar people is beyond tiring. She's not nearly as smart, cultured or educated as she thinks she is. She's a fucking high school drop out with no further education. Her pretentions of culture are just that- pretentions. Reading the occasional Malcom Gladwell book does not make you better than a person who works for a living. Plenty of plumbers have read Malcom Gladwell, too.\nI fucking LOVE Milwaukee in ways that shocked me. I love that the guys here drinking PBR do it because they love it. They wear flannel because it gets cold here and it's warm and rugged. They work with their hands. That the food is amazing because of a several hundred year long tradition of farming and fishing (which current shit policy is trying to destroy)- Milwaukee is what Portland aspires to be, in a very weird way. We don't have a dude with a flaming bagpipe on a unicycle, though. \n\u200b\n\nI want to move to Santa Clara (or the immediate environs). I know you and Enabling Uncle warned me away from a mobile home, but as a retiree, it's really a pretty good option.\u00a0I get all the amenities of an apartment or condo community, but greater privacy (and a tiny strip of land for a garden).\u00a0I can afford it. \n\nNo, Linda, you can not. People making $100k a year are in broke ass poverty in Santa Clara and you get half your dead husband's social security and half his VA pension. \nYou can NOT afford it. You can't afford a fucking $60,000 house in Kenosha, you sure as HELL cannot afford this. \n\u200b\n\nI know I won't be building equity, but I can afford to live in California. I will be in Sunnyvale (probably, Sunnyvale is home to the largest and nicest mobile home parks). I can get a mobile home for less than $150,000, which I can qualify for.\u00a0I can find a roommate (\"retired lady seeks same as roommate\") and recover most of my payment and get to split the utilities and land rent for further financial benefit.\u00a0I can fix it up and decorate it to my heart's content within the limitations of my budget.\u00a0I can have a dog (there are restrictions in apartments and condos, but less of a problem with a mobile homer).\u00a0There are half a dozen Orthodox churches within a 20-minute Uber ride of Sunnyvale.\u00a0With all of the new delivery options (most supermarkets now have order-online-and delivery options), the lack of a car will not be much of a problem.\u00a0I would be much much closer to Enabling Uncle and be able to visit more regularly. I have discovered credit card churning, and I'm earning travel reward points like crazy, so travel to SoCal would be cheap and easy.\n\nDo you see the wishful thinking about her budget? If EVERYTHING GOES PERFECT and she gets a room mate who always pays on time she can push the envelope to the very, VERY farthest limit and nothing ever ever goes wrong, breaks, and there's never an emergency, she can technically qualify. \nThis sort of thinking is why every time the transmission went out on my Dad's van or a completely predictable expense popped up I'd have to go out and hustle up a few thousand dollars to cover it. Because living at the screaming edge of your ability to pay for shit is STUPID. \nALSO WHO THE FUCK TAUGHT MY MORON OF A MOTHER ABOUT CREDIT CARD CHURNING? Her credit score was around 450 most of my damn life. WHO? That's like teaching a particularly stupid, yet self destructive toddler how to juggle flaming knives. It's not going to go well. \n\u200b\n\nI would be near my grandchildren when you and SIL start your family.I would have a much more interesting group of retired bachelors to date.\u00a0I would enjoy a delightful climate.\u00a0I would be in a dynamic city with great restaurants, shopping, and events to keep me busy.\nWill I build equity? No. Will I be able to flip it for profit? Probably not. Would this be an affordable way for me to live someplace I want to be? Yes. As a wealth-building strategy, buying a mobile home sucks. As a strategy for getting what I want out of life, it's pretty good.\n\nOh my GLOB. First, at this sentance I could HEAR my SIL's womb slam shut. She's ambivilent about having kids, she worked her ass off to get her PhD and she's still getting her career off the ground. Having my Mom decide she's going to park herself right outside her vagina and wait for the Golden Grandchild to fall out so she can insert herself as a third parent might just seal that shut forever (my brother did tell her in his reply that this was not going to happen and he would not tolerate Fucking Linda yelling at his wife or in front of his child- GO BROTHER!). I just imagine her hobgoblin ass with a catchers mit squatting under SIL's crotch, chanting \"drop one, push one out, gimmie Baby\" like the Junk Lady in the Labrynth in exactly that voice, but with a backpack of garbage made of baby crap. If that's not the best birth control available, I don't know what is.\nShe's still going on about eligable bachelors. MEN DON'T LIKE THE SMELL OF SULPHER, LINDA. Not sure you've been able to shave your horns back enough, either- we can call that demonic stubble if you like but it's soooo not attractive. You skated by for decades being a hot chick, and guess what? You're not hot anymore, and your standards for what you think you deserve in a man are so blown out of ratio to what you have to offer that you're not going to get it. Guys who have the kind of money she wants and are willing to put up with that level of crazy can get a younger model.\nAnd what the fuck shopping do you think you're going to do if you have $00.03 in the bank after your bills are paid, IF all goes perfect?  Last I checked Balenciaga wasn't in the dollar stores- there has always been that gulf between what you want vs. what you can afford.\nBUT HERE IS THE PART THAT REALLY STEAMED MY KNICKERS.\n\nMoving to California is the dearest dream of my heart. But, I am a bit nervous about it because I don't know what you think of the idea. If I am near you I will demand visits a couple of times a month, insist on equal holiday rights with SIL's family, and expect to cook for you on St. Patrick's Day. If I tried that with Bippy, she would pitch a fit. So, I thought I should check with you before embarking on my mad scheme.  \nI'll keep trying to call you. In the meantime, shoot me an e-mail and let me know if you're OK with me living right at your doorstep.\nI love you,\nMom\n\nThat part in bold... I'm sputtering. I am just about having a goddamn stroke. Who the fuck does Fucking Linda she think she is to DEMAND what breaks down to a partial custody agreement ON YOUR ADULT, COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT SON WHO HAS NOT LIVED WITH YOU IN ALMOST TWO DECADES?!?!?!?!?!? Who the fuck does she think she is to demand anything like that? Notice there's no asking. There's no checking if that would work. Also her insistance on cooking? My SIL is vegetarian bordering on vegan and my Mom has been known to spike her 'vegetarian' soup with chicken stock and pout when called on it because otherwise it 'wont taste right'. Her cooking for St. Patricks day is Corned Beef. What the hell is SIL going to eat? Not that but you can belive it'll be a shit show of guilt and crying and \"why can't you make an exception this once, for MEEEEEEEEEE?\"'\nI mean, I fucked up when I cooked their rehersal dinner because I made panna cotta for desert and while SIL could eat the cream, I forgot about the gelatin being not OK, and I felt really shitty that I made a desert that she couldn't eat. But hey, I friggen tried and that panna cotta was AMAZING (with a raspberry coulis, of course). And when she told me she couldn't eat it my first instinct wasn't to attack my marveous SIL but rather to apologize because I knew I was the one who screwed up. \nAnd she is damn right that I would loose my ever loving shit if she tried to demand, after FOUR YEARS of hard no contact, with one exception- to tell her to piss off- to get basically non custodial parent levels of custody out of me. \nSo here's a secret that will make y'alls black hearts fucking sing. In the next two months, Im going to actively start trying for a baby. I'm debating between no social media for the kid and a filtered blog with a zillion pictures because I know someone (mostly likely either my brother in a moment of weakness or my Awesome Aunt who has some serious memory issues which makes her an easier target for manipulation) will sneak Fucking Linda a picture of the fat, round, fire starting little brilliant fucker. The thought of her weeping and ganshing her teeth, wailing and bitching she does not get to play grandma while we live our best lives amuses me. And you know who will never, ever, EVER meet my child?\nFucking Linda.\n\n"}, {"title": "jnmom in: holy shit! the cops got involved!  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "721", "comments": "109", "content": "hey all!\nso, i realize it has been quite a while since my last post on here, which in my opinion is a good thing. i had been planning to hop back on at some point to tell some old stories as i work through memories with my therapist for catharsis reasons, but i had never gotten around to it. in my absence, however, a few life updates have happened that i should probably get out of the way before the meat and potatoes of the story. \nfirst, the partner i have been referencing in my previous posts and i broke up over the summer. we are still incredibly close friends and i cannot ever see a future where that changes, and i am very grateful for his support in not only my every day life but also during the events i'll be talking about here. second, i'm trans! i came out publicly in august and while it's not been without its growing pains, it remains one of the happiest decisions of my life. \nanyway, back to the reason why y'all are here. last night, as i was getting off my shift from work, my parents (who i haven't seen in person in two weeks shy of two years) showed up. \nnow i know what you're thinking. ifyouleavethelighton, haven't you moved twice since they last knew your address, worked two different jobs since then, and are currently going by a different first and last name? don't you live an eight hour drive away, in an entirely different timezone? have you not made it perfectly clear due to months of silence, blocking relatives who carry messages on behalf of jnmom, three changed emails, and a changed phone number, that you do not wish to be contacted? yes! all of that is true. but apparently, jnmom does not get subtlety very well. so instead, she and my father boarded a plane to a nearby city in another state, got a rental car, and drove to where i work. like normal, rational humans do. \nthe car was parked next to mine, which was one of only about four in the parking lot. my dad got out first, and seemed excited to see me. there was a second where i thought, \"hey, this guy looks kind of like my dad. funny, i was just thinking about him while reading a history essay today\". then, when he said \"surprise,\" i saw jnmom get out of the side of the car. at that moment, i had a facial journey that went from confusion to terror, and proceeded to run back into my workplace.  i work in a childcare facility that requires a code to get into the building. fortunately, the center i work at has excellent security (moreso than others i've worked at in the past, which made me feel even better about working there), and do not take intruders lightly. so when i ran in shouting, \"do not let them inside\", i was quickly escorted to a locked, windowless room. after explaining the situation to my confused boss, she promised me they would not be allowed past the front desk due to our security protocols and said she'd wait until they were gone to come back and check in on me for next steps. \nwhile i was locked inside said windowless room making phone calls with friends who were aware of my situation to get a plan in place so i had somewhere to go after the situation panned out, they decided to come inside the building. i couldn't hear their voices, but i heard my boss telling them that she could not let them in to see me due to policy, and they would have to leave. after a few minutes, my boss returned, with the owner of the building who happened to be stopping by to clean one of the classrooms and walked in on what will no doubt be the topic of most of my therapy sessions moving forward. i asked if we could contact the cops. they agreed. during this time, one of my coworkers stopped by to let me know that she saw the car leave. \nmy father also sent a text to my new phone number, which more or less said they wanted to meet up for dinner \"in a public space\" and that they just wanted to see how i am. \nthe cops arrive, and the officer explained that they could tell them not to contact me anymore, and if they did attempt to contact me again, they could be charged with harrassment. i agreed. after getting information for the police report, the officer left, and the owner of the school asked if i wanted him to drive me back to my apartment to pick some things up. i said yes, and while we were leaving, i asked if there was a way we could tell how long the car was sitting in the parking lot before i got out of work. he said he would, but wanted to make a few calls to get a few more things out of the way first. he then called 911 (which i was confused by, as before we had just called the nonemergency line), and after giving the operater his information, explained that after the cops left he saw a car matching the description of the one my parents had come in with plates from the same state as that car had (which is not the state i live in and is far enough away for plates from that state to be rare) in the parking lot of the building across from where i worked. i hadn't seen the car. i'm glad he did. \nlong story short, the message not to contact me was delivered in person, rather than over the phone as the officer had originally planned. the owner and i actually cirlced around the block a few times just to be sure, and i got to see them, for a split second, bathed in flashing red and blue lights. \nthe message i had the officer deliver was as followed. tell my dad i loved him, but i wasn't ready to have a relationship with him right now. say nothing to jnmom other than do not contact me again or face legal consequences. they called back to let me know that the message had been delivered. apparently they \"figured this might happen\" and \"all they wanted was to meet up for dinner\". they would be driving back to (larger city in the next state over with an airport), getting a hotel, and flying back the next morning. my dad said he loved me too, and my mom gave the officer a stuffed animal that was supposedly from my youngest brother. i asked them to keep it for me at the police station. i intend to pick it up when i get copies of the police reports for my records and moving forward on monday. i'm aware that it might not be from him, but i don't care. it's something that keeps me close to my brother, and something to keep me focused on my goal of giving all of them lives to escape to. \nso! in conclusion, this shit was incredibly calculated, much like the fake arrest warrant i mentioned in a previous post. the fact that jnmom waited to get out of the car, the gift \"from my brother\", the fact that this was two days before her birthday, all of this was planned. but she didn't expect me to fight back, and i'm certain never expected me to call the cops. but i did. because in the nearly two years since i've last spoken to her, i've gotten therapy, i've surrounded myself with good people, i've worked to build a new life for myself from the ground up, and i have one hell of a backbone. she may have broken me in the past, but she certainly won't be going forward. \nas for how i'm spending my weekend? well, i had already planned to spend it with my dear friend who lives in a city a few hours north of me, who, upon hearing the news, left work early to pick me up. actually, while, \"dear friend\" is accurate, it isn't entirely - while on the drive back to his place, we confronted months of romantic tension and confessed our feelings for each other. tomorrow we'll drive back, and i'll be spending the next week with some friends who have more or less adopted me as their own. from there, i'll get copies of the police report, get in contact with a local domestic violence organization, work to get a confidential legal name change, and probably schedule some extra therapy sessions as needed. \nhope the rest of y'all are having a lovely weekend, and stay safe \ud83d\udc9b i know i will be\n\n"}, {"title": "MIL laughs about my hair loss, believing she\u2019s immune to cancer  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "6417", "comments": "330", "content": "I\u2019m fighting cancer. An early-stage, fortunately, so things should go well. Right now I\u2019m going through chemo, which means I\u2019m losing my hair. Today I got sick and tired of finding hair everywhere I go, so I decided to just shave it off and call it a day. It\u2019s not so bad as I thought it would be, I kinda like this look actually. \nMy husband is away for a job trip and will be back after a month or so, but my 20-year-old son has a few days off before he goes back to college and he\u2019s staying in our house. MIL came over, saw me without hair and just burst into laughter. She was laughing aloud as if she just heard the funniest joke ever. She was like \u201dOh my God, you look as if God was drunk when he made a human! You look like a damn shaved egg! You look like an inmate that has got out of prison after decades! Jesus, you look so silly!\u201d \nBefore I managed to say something, my son heard what MIL said and was like \u201dShut your effin\u2019 mouth before I do it for you. Look at your own mug in the mirror, like a scarecrow from the yard of a loony bin.\u201d \nMIL wasn\u2019t expecting this, of course. She stopped laughing and pouted that he can\u2019t talk to his grandma like that. She said that I must be ready for comments like this because people immediately will see I\u2019m ill. \nMy son was like \u201dWell, be careful, don\u2019t kick the bucket yourself.\u201d  \nMIL said \u201dOh honey, I\u2019ll be fine! I have no family history of cancer so I don\u2019t have to worry about that!\u201d  \nWell, guess what, MIL \u2013 neither do I. In my entire family I\u2019m the first person to have cancer. When I got sick, I tracked my family's medical history as far as I could and from what I found, no one of my relatives has ever had cancer. Of course, I don\u2019t wish it upon her, but her thinking is kinda flawed. Yes, maybe it puts you at less risk of getting cancer than someone who has a family history of it, but it doesn\u2019t grant you immunity. Cancer doesn\u2019t discriminate. \nThis is a nasty trait of my MIL. Whenever she sees someone with a disability or someone who because of a health condition visually looks different than others, or just someone who has a major illness, she often sneers and comments that this person must have done this or that to end up in that condition and it\u2019s their own fault. \nIt has always seemed so weird to me because you don\u2019t know what awaits you in the future. Today you\u2019re healthy and tomorrow you might not be able to get out of bed. MIL\u2019s so sure she\u2019s going to be fine at all times and that her health is the strongest of them all. It\u2019s like diseases don\u2019t exist to her, it\u2019s something that happens to everyone else, but her. \nThen she was like \u201dBut really, wear a wig. You don\u2019t want to walk around looking like a bald alien. You\u2019re a woman after all.\u201d \nI told her that wether I wear a wig or not will be my choice and her comments are highly inappropriate and I don\u2019t have to tolerate it in my own house. MIL was like \u201dJesus, stop being so dramatic. You know yourself people laugh at bald women. How about you just wear a wig and calm down?\u201d \nMy son said \u201dHow about you get the f out of here? Be careful walking down the stairs, don\u2019t bump your already stupid head into something.\u201d \nI don\u2019t really understand why was it necessary to comment anything about my hair. And if she absolutely had to, she could do so without being mean.

I had thought about the comments that many of you made in that moment and I was afraid to say but I needed to say it and I knew she needed to hear it or I needed her to hear it. I said \" ln all honesty you have never been a mother to me, spreading your legs and pushing out a baby does not make you a mother. It can make you an egg donor, a fetal oven but not a mother. My MIL has been more of a mom than you ever have. You have treated me like dirt all my life and I'm tired of it.

I said \" I get what you are doing, you are judging me based on what you would do or YOUR sister would do but I'm not either of you. I unlike you did not chase a married man and then have his baby only for him to not acknowledge you or the baby that's what you did. I didn't have children and/or unprotected sex and get pregnant in h.s. that's what you did. The only man I have been with is my husband.

They are the only men who have been genuinely concerned for me like a brother should. So please stop your projecting bc we both know that, that's something you would do if you were in my situation.

So no I won't need and I certainly won't miss you. I'm done and if you try to put your hands on me I will press charges just know that.\" I walked away after that but I had so many emotions running through me  I just had to walk home. I had to get that negative energy out. I came home and told DH what I just wrote for you guys, and he said \"Good.\" Right now I feel scared and out of sorts. I'm sorry for any typos I'm on my front porch typing this on my phone. So this is it? My husband asked if I wanted to move like into the city or another town I was like IDK. He says we could move to the neighboring state as there is a commuter train and he drives to work, I don't want to put him through that. So I said no to the state but agreed we should move to another town to ensure we get the space we need. What do you think? I'm not concerned where suing for visitation of my DD bc the way she keeps her house she would never be granted access and she doesn't have the money to hire a lawyer and she doesn't like small children like that.

I do love some of those photos. \nBut why in the hell did this woman think it was okay to post these photos to her very public Facebook before I even had the chance to ...breastfeed? ...shower off the gore? ...tell the rest of my family I had given birth? \nShe tagged me, she tagged my SO, she announced my sons name. We hadn\u2019t even known the gender until he was born, so she leaked that as well. Rude.\nSO called her out and she just shrugged. \nIf there is a next time I think I\u2019ll just forget to tell her what hospital we\u2019ll be at. Hmph.\n\n"}, {"title": "Checking In  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "4349", "comments": "194", "content": "Recap: I'm in my late 20s and my JNMOM (Artsy) had near complete control of my life. She was emotionally and verbally abusive and I was virtually a prisoner in my own home. I'm currently seeing a therapist openly and I escaped on January 10, 2020. \nFirst things first. I'm doing great. Scratch that I'm doing fucking amazing. Besides the occasional random crying jags I've felt more at peace than I ever have.\nI've gone out a few times with friends and coworkers and I'm learning that I'm mostly a homebody. But I don't feel trapped at all. I've been crafting, getting my cosplays ready for comiccon next month, etc. I've also been experimenting with my personal style. Turns out I have two aesthetics: comfortable lumberjack and high femme witch. \nI kind of have something possibly happening with one of my coworkers (don't worry we work in completely unrelated departments and my workplace doesn't have an anti fraternization policy.) Even if nothing comes of this it's just nice to flirt with someone and not feel like shit for it. \nNow unto what Artsy has been up to. The reason why her phone never seemed to leave her house is because she's been \"bedridden with grief.\" She's been making various family members cater to her every whim while she plays the victim. Lol I can't wait till they all get sick of her shit and this all blows up in her face. I'm still getting family members calling me every now and then to \"check up on me and make sure I'm safe.\" On some level I'm sure they're actually worried about me but they are so obviously fishing for anything they can report back to Artsy. All I've been telling them is about how much happier I am. I hope they tell her that every time and that it burns her inside. \nAll is quiet on the western.\nP.S. I've had a few people pm me asking for advice dealing with/getting out of similar situations. I honestly don't know what I can offer but I will do my absolute best to support you. The best advice I've got is plan as much as possible. Have plans for your plans. Not only is it a productive way to pass the time but it gives you such a peace of mind when you feel like you're prepared for every eventuality. Good luck to all of you.\nEdit: Because a few of you asked. I'm going to Emerald City Comiccon. I'll be wearing a Rainbow Brite inspired casual outfit for Thursday. A full lolita coord on Friday. Velma from Scooby Doo on Saturday. And finally comic book Hawkeye on Sunday. \nI DO NOT CONSENT FOR THIS STORY TO BE POSTED OR USED ANYWHERE WITHOUT MY EXPRESS PERMISSION.\n\n"}, {"title": "MIL mad I used ASL  (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "4327", "comments": "255", "content": "SO (24F) and I (23F) have been dating since senior year of high school. We got married in 2018 and decided to adopt after we got married. We got married in February and started fostering a little girl in August. Daughter (D) is 5 years old and deaf, I\u2019m also deaf and SO learned sign language when we first started dating. I\u2019ve been using Cochlear\u2019s for a while but D has never used them and decided he doesn\u2019t want them. SO, D and I went to MIL\u2019s house for a birthday party last week. I was signing to D as she wanted to talk. She\u2019s really shy so she has only given MIL a soft smile and wave. I signed to D if she wanted any food and signed to SO to go grab it for her. MIL didn\u2019t like the fact she \u201cwasn\u2019t included in the conversation\u201d and started yelling and freaking out. She was calling me and my daughter disrespectful and arrogant. Telling my severely deaf daughter to \u201cjust speak goddamnit\u201d and \u201cbe a normal kid\u201d D started to cry as she knew MIL was mad but couldn\u2019t figure out why. I took her and left hoping SO would follow (she did). My deafness has never been an issue to MIL as far as I know. But apparently me signing to my daughter is too far. She texted SO later that night saying we were abusing my daughter for not letting her get cochlear implants. My daughter has said she doesn\u2019t want them. I\u2019m not forcing her to do anything. We\u2019re fostering her in hopes of adopting her, she\u2019s a really sweet girl who\u2019s parents just couldn\u2019t take care of her properly. (The mom was 15). I got a call from MIL saying how my daughter is a ret**d and will never be full functioning in a hearing world. I talked to SO and I want to cut out MIL but we don\u2019t know how we should I go about it. Should we cut out all contact with that whole side of the family? SO thinks that\u2019s the right idea but SO\u2019s dad is a really nice man and I want him to be in D\u2019s life. Any advice?\nEdit: After talking to SO and D we\u2019ve all agreed to cut contact with MIL. The rest of the family has yet to answer our text \n\u201cWe have made the decision to no longer expose D to MIL. If you still want to have contact with our family and D you must be willing to learn even the bare minimum of sign language. MIL will not be addressed near D and she will be blocked on any socials. If you do not agree with this then we will cut contact with you as well.\u201d \nFIL is still going to be actively in her life as they have a special bond I refuse to break. FIL has agreed to our terms and even suggested a restraining order so she can\u2019t mess with our adoption process\nD is very happy and as of right now I haven\u2019t told her what MIL said about her. SO and I agreed to just keep it at a \u201cGrandma isn\u2019t a nice person so we aren\u2019t seeing her anymore\u201d \nThank you everyone for your support and if you were wondering Yes my parents are very supportive of me and SO\u2019s marriage and they love D to death\nEdit 2: Thank you for the Silver!!\nEdit 3: UPDATED!!\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/fmsr25/mil_defeated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n"}, {"title": "Mother in law ruined the birth of my son 4 days ago UPDATE (self.JUSTNOMIL)", "likes": "4768", "comments": "424", "content": "So here is my original post \nruined birth OP \n(Sorry if it doesn\u2019t work I have no idea how to use technology\ud83d\ude43) \nFirstly thank you so much to everyone who commented. I could not believe the kindness and validation. It really overwhelmed me and made me realise just how fucked up the birth of my son was.  I actually sent the link to my partner the day I wrote the post and he thought it was just a really similar birth story. I was like no.. I wrote that. He was shocked at the comments, devastated at the realisation he\u2019d fucked up so badly and immediately brought it up with his mother. \nShe accused me of being over dramatic, horrible, removed all the pictures of the baby from her social media. There was a back and forth of arguing between my partner and my MIL for a few days and FIL told me not to expect an apology from her because it\u2019s just \u201chow she is\u201d \nYesterday she DID message me and said sorry for the misunderstanding, and basically turned everything round to her not understanding she wasn\u2019t meant to be there (\ud83d\ude16) I haven\u2019t responded but my partner thinks this is the best I\u2019m going to get and I should accept it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough. I haven\u2019t responded to her message and she keeps messaging my partner asking him why I haven\u2019t replied. \nBreastfeeding is going well and I\u2019m enjoying my lovely baby but I\u2019m pretty depressed at the moment and a lot of that feeling is to do with awful birth. I\u2019m not healing correctly and I can still hardly walk\nAgain thank you so much for the response to my ORiginal post. If anyone has more advice for what I can do or say I\u2019d appreciate it. \nIn regards to medical staff not intervening i have made a complaint and am awaiting response.\n\n"}]]}
