Our relationship is occasionally a push pull (bc I am very independent and she is very in need of attention and love) but we have grown so much individually because of our differences.\nShe taught me to empathize, listen, support people in the way they need to be supported, check in with friends far away, and generally to be a better person to myself and others. I taught her to stand up for herself, to trust her own intelligence, and to occasionally try to block out the social cues she is getting espec when they are negative vibes (it affects her wayyyy more than most people).\nShe takes things personally, but I think it's bc her \"sixth sense\" for people's thoughts/feelings and her emotional intelligence can make her self-conscious or feel defensive/embarrassed. I am totally oblivious to stuff like that and it weirdly makes me more confident (although I am the introvert and she the extrovert). I want her to get to that point too! I think I used to have a tendency to let my arrogance affect the way we talked to each other & the merit I would put into things she would tell me. Obviously now that I am older I regret that. She is the absolute best person - so thoughtful, endlessly caring, and FULL of love for her people.\nShe is a total empath and I am a bit of a depressive personality, so I want to make sure I am uplifting her, not bringing her down, and that she has others to connect the way she needs to. :) Any tips on helping to support her are appreciated. \nTL;DR: I'm an INTJ w an ENFP twin, she is the reason I am at all emotionally competent. \nSo twins - what are your types and how do you think that they affect your relationship?\n[edit:] if you want to answer this also, are you identical or fraternal?\n\n"}, {"title": "The perks of being an INTJ  (self.intj)", "likes": "54", "comments": "31", "content": "1. THE GOOD ONES\n\nYou don\u2019t keep a lot of expectations from other people.\nYou don\u2019t feel disappointed when people don\u2019t keep up their promises(maybe a little but you move on quickly).\nPeople can\u2019t hurt you emotionally(biggest advantage I guess).\nYou learn a lot by yourself.\nYou actually enjoy solitude.\nYou can solve complex problems because you actually use your brain logically rather than emotionally.\n\n\u200b\n2. THE BAD ONES\n\nYou don\u2019t have a lot of friends for support(because you are your own pillar of strength). But it feels good to have friends around sometimes.\nYou feel rather awkward in social situations like parties and get togethers and act like an object out of place because you haven\u2019t had a lot of social interactions lately(just because you don\u2019t like it).\nPeople think you might be a wierdo because you don\u2019t express a lot of facial emotions in situations which demand it(like when you are the topper of your class and people come to congratulate you and you don\u2019t put on a smile and just shake their hands and say \u2018thank you\u2019 and people go around telling others that you\u2019re egoistic).\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Is this the right sub for me?

Plus my track record is pretty crazy, for example my main day job has experienced 66% YoY growth from a previous 8% trajectory for their eCommerce sales (not to mentioned 680% increase in direct leads) - pretty much the same story with my freelance clients too, all from a wide range of industries - eg,my regular clients include an aircraft parts manufacturer, antique dealer, corporate HR firm and a coffee house.\nIt's like I'm stuck in a continuous self-improvement loop (which I think is the turbulent nature of my personality - always self analyzing) and if a career doesn't fulfill my need to learn and develop both my creativity and my logical/strategic side, I move on. Also, I've had employers take liberties on my work ethic in the past, and just pile on more and more responsibilities and constantly move KPI goal posts with no additional support or remuneration (which is actually the situation I am in currently). \nBeing INTJ, my career has always been hampered by my social inadequacies - I don't do traditions,  I'm shit at thinking on the fly and I can come across a bit flat, I also have a nasty habit of under selling myself (ie when talking about my work I will hyper focus on what I could have done better rather than focusing on what I've achieved - I am working on this though). During meetings I appear as disengaged - which is never the case, as I like to think before I speak.\nIt frustrates me that my apparent lack of enthusiasm is in complete contrast with how fascinated I am by the industry I am in, and I spend every spare moment outside of work and family time researching - my idea of a good evening is watching a 3 hour long tutorial on building out a marketing funnel and then being so enthused that I end up spending a further 3 hours building it myself (queue going to bed at 3am, waking up for work at 7am - this happens at least once a week).\nAnyway, I'm rambling now - I just wanted to see if there are any others out there as weird as me, and with a similar back story?\n\n"}, {"title": "I'm not sure if it happens to other introverts but you ever just feel like you're happy and then someone sees it as an invitation to interupt your alone time to maybe spice things up even more and you end up feeling extra uncomfortable?

Ever since then, I have trouble making friends.\nI'm an introvert (INTJ-T), and I dislike going out often but when I do go out I would consider myself very social.

(self.intj)", "likes": "3", "comments": "3", "content": "So, first of all, I'm not that sure about being an INTJ or an INTP and that's mostly because of my approach to studying and related things to it.\nI was quite good at HS, my average was an A when I finished it but the way  I did was quite weird.So, in middle school, I didn't skip many classes, at least as far as I remember and I was rather a C/B student than an A student. I got how things worked fully by the time I entered my HS, well, I always knew how they were but I just decided to change my attitude to it. My school didn't care that much about the attendance rate but about their student's grade rate, so I decided to skip pretty much often, I skipped like 30-35% of my last school year. First of all, I found it quite easy to study subjects at high school, so anytime I attended classes I answered them, sometimes without preparing, sometimes studying during the class or just before it. Everything was relatively easy, even exams were so. I was sitting rather in the first row or in the last: In the first case because I wanted to interact with my teacher well, in the second case because 2 of my friends were always sitting there. The reason why I was skipping was that I hated going there, I didn't hate the process of sitting there and just being there, I didn't hate my school itself. I just hated that I have to waste my time on it because I could do other things that were more interesting to me and I could simply better take some sleep than going there. I was self-teaching myself. I sure knew I wanted to enter university so I was preparing on my own. I never learnt English at my school, in middle school I got a C on that but when I started learning it on my own I easily got an A. I prepared for all my exams on my own and got As on them. My parents decided to send me to additional lessons with private teachers but I hated the idea and eventually managed to talk them out from that.\nSo I managed to enter one of the top unis in my country so I felt rather happy about it but I wasn't that glad about my majors. It's regional science while I'd like to code more. Anyways, I took first weeks quite serious to understand how It works and what I will do and It seemed the same as easy as It was in my HS. I sit rather in the first or the second row, the same reason as It was. I skip a lot, uni stated that students mustn't skip more than 36h in a term but I realized It was not that true. If my grades are fine and I don't skip too much, I'm safe. So I skipped about 60h-70h in my first midterm and nothing happened, I closed my exams A-B-A-A. But It's this year, I actually entered my uni a year before but I took a year off because I was stupid, I won't deny it. My grades were fine and I skipped pretty the same but I was failing my german language, although anything would tell It was that big of a problem but I felt depressed that year, there were reasons for that but still It was rather stupid. After that, I started feeling insecure as hell about studying: I always feel like I can be expelled and that's really not on my plan. This year my grades are fine but my new language class (which is Korean) makes me feel insecure, that's the only subject I got a bad grade (E). I still don't study for my classes pretty much at all and especially since It's online classes now. I always cheat on or slam off everything I'm given to do. I do that because I know It'll work. I knew how to trick on the anti-plagiarism system so all my papers are not actually mine but the system never found it out so I got all As on them. I always find short-ways to do my homework, like, I do my Korean home literally just translating things in google, changing some words to those that are supposed to be used (I just cntr+F our book) and then give it to Koreans in a discord server to check it. I actually did my translation test exactly like that I got my first C+ on Korean (before It was F-D). I realize I should study it and I do but It's not that easy, unfortunately, so I set up a plan that I have to study Korean every day for 2 hours. I'm just bad at memorizing stuff from doing the same thing again and again (remote memory), I wouldn't say that I get things through practizing either. I understand it conceptually, I know-how It should be but because of not remembering all stuff at once I suck at it.\nSo I know what I want from it, I wouldn't say I don't care about my grades (although I often say it irl but more in an ironic way). I'd even say I want to be an A student but because of my Korean and PE, oh yes, I forgot about PE classes, yes, they also influence our grade and they're obligatory, the attendance rate is the grade of this crappy subject and what do you think I got on that? a D for sure. So due to some reasons, my average in the first midterm was a C++.  I also code and I strive for learning it fully and I want to try it as a job. So I want to do completely not what I'm studying but I'll still do that to feel safe. It's due to many reasons I planned for my future.\nAbout how I sit in classes, well, usually I dream away and my attention is the worst thing here. Even if I try to focus, later on, I forget about focusing. I might have ADHD but I don't think I will see some therapy.\nYet I forgot to mention how I hate PE, that's just pointless for me and that's all.\nSo that's pretty much it. Would you relate to it?

He was a pretty objectively popular person, cared a lot about his friends, and could be a bit of an asshole when it came to girls. He also had commitment issues. We took a 16p-style test junior year (probably very inaccurate), and he got ENFP.\nI lost touch with him for a few years, and got to know him again in 2018 as friends. When I re-met him, it seemed like he had become an entirely different person. He was in an abusive relationship for 3 years and had become really mellow. He has diagnosed depression and anxiety, but refuses to get treatment or take medication. He does smoke and use psychedelics. He no longer cares about his grades in school (senior in college\u2014a very good one, too), but he's really meticulous when it comes to cleaning his environment or cooking for himself. He spends most of his time at the gym, which he says is the one thing he enjoys doing. He also likes herpetology and owns several pythons (but this is something from high school as well). He has a very minimalist lifestyle and doesn't care about his outward appearance nearly as much as he used to in high school. He's lost when it comes to future aspirations, though he might want to be a veterinarian. He admits to being a bit emotionally independent on his other ex-girlfriend (who has BPD). His political leanings are liberal. He loves films and underground music. He paints a bit.\nI think this part is why he thinks he's an INTJ. He has a very strong opinion on relationships, as he thinks that relationships are less about mutual admiration and respect and more about wanting to control the other person. He despises relationship-related constructs, such as monogamy and marriage. He thinks any relationship, platonic or otherwise, is purely about time, place, and convenience, and he doesn't check in with the friends he seemed to have cared so much about in high school. He generally has a low opinion of humanity and wants to get out of the country and live somewhere very remote if he can in the future. He would definitely try to play God, if he had the chance. He claims that I'm the only woman he's ever been able to have an intelligent conversation with (he also claims he's not sexist, but these are his words). He's extremely nihilistic, paranoid, and stubborn. He thinks feelings aren't real and can be reasoned away. He also says that the person he was in high school was a facade, a personality he based off of one of his friends' (who ran with the same crowd as he did) in order to be more successful.\nDoes he sound like an INTJ? I could maybe see it, but have my doubts, so I wanted to hear other opinions. Whatever he is, he's definitely an unhealthy one (I was thinking he might be in subconscious or unconscious).

He is nice enough to me, but there is nothing personal, like I said he is very professional and has almost no personal relationships with anyone in the department.

I don't have to visit a busy office, talk to other employees, or be pressured to act like I give two shits what any of them are talking about.  Working from home is actually very delightful, and I mistakenly alluded to as much during a Zoom team meeting this afternoon with my boss and my boss's boss in attendance.

The Zoom quickly moved on to someone else and before it finished, I had Slack messages from both of them asking to clarify exactly what I meant by what I said.  I have yet to directly respond to them.  My IT team is well known as being placaters, ass-kissers, and general pushovers to anyone who wants anything...except for me.

Hands down the most fun and exciting project I have ever invested my time into. Every free moment of my time is spent either working on the website directly or researching, creating mock-ups, consuming internet articles and YouTube videos like I\u2019ll go into panicked despair without the constant bombardment of information. I have a notebook glued to my side now at all times so I won\u2019t forget any thoughts when I\u2019m away from the computer. SEO, ads, legalities, coding, graphic design and photoshop, branding, marketing, business jargon I never bothered to understand previously - information aplenty! \nNever thought I would say this, but I really wish I could work with other people on this project. I want my brand board to be massacred with unfettered explanation. I want new ideas from people that don\u2019t think like I do. I want to knock around ideas with people I can trust who actually bother to think about things. \nMy SO does a certain variety of e-commerce full time and is an amazing resource, but he is busy all day doing this and is brain fried wanting to rest when he gets home. So it\u2019s no good to lean on him and only him. My friends don\u2019t really care about any of this/they don\u2019t know about certain things to have meaningful discussion, which is totally fine. Plus I don\u2019t really like opening up ideas to people who aren\u2019t willing to dish any back. \nI\u2019m part of some private groups specifically for these types of discussions. Here\u2019s what I see: the need to stay vague and the inherent distrust of online strangers does not foster transparency, which hampers peoples ability to communicate their specific concerns. Great for technical questions that Google can\u2019t answer, but the advice, while occasionally helpful, is often too broad or generalized. Often you will see conflicting advice - the resolution would only be a further, in-depth understanding of the company to give a true right answer. There\u2019s both silo mentality and the constant reiteration to figure things out for yourself. \nThat\u2019s on the owner, that\u2019s part of the risk - yes. Discuss, but keep your cards close. Self education and awareness is obviously paramount. However, in these early stages, nothing beats true interpersonal brainstorming from individuals you trust. For me, I HAVE to understand the thought process behind a suggestion being made. One liner simple answers are discouraging. Even if it sounds right, I have to know how they got there. How do I know they considered all the aspects I did?\nI\u2019m wondering if there are any business owners here who have experience with managing passion and ideas, and the personal steps taken to get there. \nWhat have your experiences been? \nWho have you trusted? \nWhat was the best advice you received? \nWhat\u2019s something you struggled with? \nThanks in advance, looking forward to reading comments.\n\n"}], [{"title": "ENFP Relationships - Successes and Failures (self.intj)", "likes": "2", "comments": 0, "content": "INTJ-ENFP pairings are classic to the point of clich\u00e9 in MBTI circles.

Just pleasantries, being nice to warm the mood of the conversation.\nI think a lot of INTJ's will see this as \"small talk\" and useless.  Some probably think they're too good for it.  In a way I can see that, in another I think sometimes we are pretentious in ways like this (speaking as an INTJ, dating an INTJ).\nI want to say that I am an American.  In the US, we see it as polite to basically say a lot of nice things when we talk to people, even if we don't really mean it or care (eg. \"How are you?\")  I've known foreigners who see these as empty and not genuine, but not using these can be seen as rude or put some people off.  \nI work with people as my career.  It's not so much customer service as it is helping people navigate choices and such.  Being as nice and polite as possible makes everything smoother.  People exhaust me, and the quickest way to get them in and out of my office is to keep a pleasant mood and try to be as pleasant as possible.  It makes everything go smoother.\nI see the value in keeping a pleasant mood and rapport with people, so I make it a point to smile at people and say good morning.  My bf comes from a culture where people aren't that friendly to people they don't know, they don't smile much, and they get straight to the point, and he doesn't see the point in pleasantries.

This will probably sound like depression (I don't think it is) but I started to see all personal goals somewhat arbitrary, with the only tangible thing that can be reached being a coffin. \nSo I eased on the long-term planning quite a bit, as it seems kind of arbitrary. I'm still doing personal projects and researching things that interest me but I find it hard to dedicate to a distant goal, and wonder whether that's really the thing I want to spend my time with. I moved onto more small-ish, short-term (no longer than a few months, usually) projects. Still learning things for a clear purpose of achieving the goal, but no grand plans. Not gonna lie, not having a long-term goal for life is really disconcerting. I just can't come up with anything significant enough to be worth it. The idea of perfecting a skill/knowledge which ends up being a waste of time is a nightmare. \nLiving an efficient routine is very intj thing and I had that for years and years.

He had been checking me out for six months +, so I knew he liked me.  My first ever and very long-term relationship had ended a few weeks prior. I was still wounded and  thought nothing could hurt me thereafter, so I was quite assertive and confident. When we met  I told him straight away that I would be leaving in a month as my contract expired.\nWe then met up regularly for coffee breaks, lunch or dinner over a month, though I always felt left quite high and dry in between (not getting text for multiple days, then getting asked out quite last minute, which annoyed me, but did not faze me as I was in my nothing-can-hurt me state. Further I also attributed it to the VERY long hours, high pressure environment in his department. One evening he comes by and we drink a bit pf alcohol. He then opened up and told me I was beautiful and made his day better, that his past relationship was not quite resolved, and that he needed time (they were together for a year and had been broken up or on a break for a year at that point).  I've never seen a man more hurt, but I've also never met a more genuine and honest man. He just had the purest and most beautiful soul which revealed itself then, though he is always rather reserved and shy/private in public.  I also told him about my situation, and that he was too good for a rebound (which in my emotional post-break up confusion I thought I was looking for, but I am really not the type for that and have not been with anyone, or dated since). He said that he was confused (to the effect of between me and the other), and that we would stay in touch.\nWe have stayed in touch since, but it has all been initiated by myself and I do not know if he is really interested still, as it's been a year. We texted regularly for a month after I left, then met up in summer for lunch whilst being in the same city by coincidence and it was very natural but I was a bit pushy and he was still confused. We have been in different countries since last summer, and when I text him he will reply, usually with delays up to two weeks. \nHe does not initiate text, but he does reply (though no proper conversation has emerged...). He has however affirmed plans of meeting up or talking on the phone, but then cancelled. A month ago I suggested to call, immediate reply yes tomorrow, then cancelled on the day and shoots me a message of how he is bad with replies 10 days (!) later! (I was annoyed and replied to the effect of if you want to stay in touch let's do it properly and talk on the phone as I find text messages confusing, no reply to that of course).\nI am still very inexperienced with men and have not been with anyone since, however I do have male friends who are however quite different from him. When asking others for advice, some tell me to just let it go because he's clearly not interested. But why does he still reply then? We have been in different countries and he could just let it go or tell me he's no longer interested, which he has not. Then others tell me that people are different and that he is probably still confused and needs time.\nI can usually read people well, but not him and I have never met anyone like him. Nonetheless, and I cannot quite explain it, for some reason, I just feel sure about him. I had the feeling we could have a lot of fun and a happy, stable future. We also have the same values and he meets MANY criteria. This sounds very odd, but it is true, just as I felt that the few words he told me were more true than anything I ever heard from any other man. So I know he told me the truth. He is also extremely funny, more so than any other men I know, and whilst of course I still don't know him well I want the chance to get to know him even better. From his comments he definitely views commitment as forever and he wants stability. \nAm I just impatient, and he is still interested, or am I just oblivious to disinterest, but he is still too nice to say he's no longer interested?  Or is it just kept lukewarm because confusion is ongoing?\nAside from mentioning \"let's stay in touch better and talk on the phone\", I have not asked, because well, it's been a while and given the context I feel quite silly to be spending so much emotional energy on a hypothetical. Also, I didn't want to be emotionally pushy.\nI only read up on Myer-Briggs classifiers recently when I saw that the type description fit very well, so there may be a chance I can get some clarity from similar-minded individuals. That's why I'm posting here. \nWhat's the judgement of  the INTJ jury? Is the curious creature interested or not? Is it normal to take years to make emotional decisions? I am puzzled. \n(Yes, I am focusing on myself - finishing my masters, starting a long distance degree and doing my thing; it's said that dating is a numbers game, the purpose of which is also to gain clarity, and I've thought about it quite long and he or someone like him would be worth the wait. Before thinking about any other logistics, I just wish an assessment of interest level. However, after my last relationship I want to make sure the next attempt is with the right person, and for good, and he's definitely set a standard. According to the typology I'm an INFJ - which I think is accurate by around 70%).\nThank you in advance for your insights! It's been a year and it's been on my mind a lot so it should get resolved at some point!\n\n"}, {"title": "How do you spoilers(in regards to movies and stuff like that)?

You find negativity all around you and any minute negativity irritates you. You lose your temper easily. As days go by, you feel hopeless.

Unfortunately, this can mean you take your frustrations out on those closest to you \u2013 those who probably don\u2019t deserve it.  \nYou are always feeling low and lack motivation in your life.\nYou always feel that something bad is going to happen. You have lost faith in life and there\u2019s nothing that can motivate you to move on. You feel like you\u2019re incapable of getting the work done. You struggle to find the motivation you need. The goals that once stimulated you to work hard are not enough. This is especially difficult to contend with when you\u2019re at the workplace or school since there are inevitably due dates for various tasks or assignments. But if you are not motivated to get to those tasks, you won\u2019t get them done on time\u2026 so they\u2019ll accumulate, which will make you procrastinate more. This can result in you failing classes or getting warnings at work. But if you\u2019re feeling numb, you really won\u2019t care much about that, will you?  \nYou experience fits of anxiety quite often.\nAs a result of your over-exhaustion, you feel more and more stressed than usual. Anxiety attacks are becoming a daily routine. You get worried unnecessarily. You are anxious at the slightest of things.  \nYou can\u2019t sleep properly.\nYou often feel like you are out of the place. The overwhelming feeling of exhaustion makes it harder for you to calm your thoughts and fall asleep. And insomnia becomes just another thing on the list. You are so very, very tired, all the time, and all you want to do is sleep, but you can\u2019t. Why? Because your thoughts are racing at top speed and you can\u2019t break the loop. Just as you start to drift off, some worry will intrude and knock you back into wakefulness, so you can\u2019t get that much-needed rest\u2026 which compounds the fatigue that\u2019s already draining you dry.  \nYou sense a kind of detachment.\nYou don\u2019t feel you\u2019ve attached to anyone or anything anymore. Nothing affects you. You don\u2019t feel good or bad. It\u2019s like you are just a body without any emotion. You\u2019ve gone numb. Whatever it is that you\u2019re dealing with has drained your light to the point where you literally can\u2019t feel the emotions you\u2019d normally feel when you encounter a situation or subject. This is sort of like depression, only instead of feeling weighed down by emotion, you\u2019re weighed down by the absence thereof.  \nYou cry or feel like crying for no reason at all.\nIf you\u2019re at the point where having toothpaste fall off your toothbrush first thing in the morning is enough to bring you to a bout of hysterical weeping\u2026that\u2019s not good at all. When we\u2019re exhausted both physically and mentally, we pretty much lose the strength to cope with challenging situations, and regular day-to-day stress is intensified. It\u2019s totally understandable that you\u2019ve probably found yourself crying in front of colleagues, friends, or even random strangers. \nYou feel dizzy and nauseous.\nA feeling of nausea and dizziness are signs that you need rest and it should be your primary priority. These things happen because you are so stressed out that your body can\u2019t take it anymore and is suffering a break-down. Whenever a person experiences a mental breakdown, this naturally manifests physically as well. This is especially true if you\u2019re the sort of person who carries stress in your belly, or if you clench your muscles subconsciously to brace against whatever is hurting you.  \nYou\u2019re constantly tired.\nFatigue is something different from just regular tiredness. We can be exhausted after a few days\u2019 worths of partying, but that kind of exhaustion can be remedied with a couple of nights\u2019 worth of decent sleep. Fatigue can\u2019t. When you\u2019re suffering from fatigue, it doesn\u2019t matter if you sleep 20 hours a day or drink 30 coffees in the span of a few hours: you will still be tired to the very marrow in your bones.

I told her a few things about myself so she could get to know me better, and she was surprised by one of the things I told about. I also asked her questions to get to know her better.\nBut at one point I noticed that she didn't ask any questions, she just read everything I told her, I made the comment that why she wasn't curious to ask me about something.

(self.intj)", "likes": "5", "comments": "9", "content": "Hello, this is my first post on Reddit. I decided to write it here because I feel like I've been conflicting myself. I don't like strict rules but dear me, if there's a boss who's always angry like Gordon Ramsay but knows what He's doing, I would gladly switch my current job.\nA bit of background story if you want a concrete example:\nI'm an INTJ. 25 years old. I have been working as a Programmer for almost 5 yeas now. I work in a very small team where everything isn't organized and the \"vision\" and \"targets\" my boss told me are never clear. Each one of team member was told to finish specific projects at the start of the year but every time it doesn't work out it's always the same old \"Well, next year it is then\" \"Well, next year maybe We will outsource it because We're not capable\" \"Well, just laugh it off\" etc etc.\nIt is a bit ridiculous when your boss already set a limit on what you can do and judge you as an average person, so that if things are failing, We're just bad at it. Effectively preventing us to be better at our jobs, to grow and turning us into a SINGLE point of failure when things go wrong. What does my head in is that, it's not because We're not capable of finishing the projects (hint: We're paid as Programmers) but the boss rarely manage the projects and it's all down to us. The programmers have so much type of work that often get mixed up together, slowing the whole project down\nOften times He would start a Project and do the intro and the intro ONLY. He would invite people for a meeting, say a few words at the start and that's it, after that He walks outside of the room while answering Phone calls from his wife. Then He will often miss the next meetings due to reasons god knows what.\nThen the entire business process analysis, negotiation, time line creation, designs, coding, testing and user followups are done by ONE person only and that person is a fricking Programmer (written in the Job Desc) that often has very little say in Project Management. This boss is literally the complete opposite of the strict ones because He lets you do whatever it is that you want and theoretically, it should fit INTJ. But I feel like having one like this is much worse because after all You only have two hands and one head.\nHe's always playing it safe, if you tell him about newer things We could try to improve the process, He will go \"Umm ok, we will try it next year, You will try it, not me\" and by next year He will repeat the same thing. I often find myself with a lot of type of tasks to do such as sending email to the users, testing bugs, fixing it, coding new functions, designing with Photoshop, answering phone calls and even adjusting my own targets as if I don't have a boss... It's madness. I've become much more of a grumpy person due to this.\nWhat say You?\n\n"}], [{"title": "Are any of you guys an INTJ twin? If yes, what is your twin's type?

I taught her to stand up for herself, to trust her own intelligence, and to occasionally try to block out the social cues she is getting espec when they are negative vibes (it affects her wayyyy more than most people).\nShe takes things personally, but I think it's bc her \"sixth sense\" for people's thoughts/feelings and her emotional intelligence can make her self-conscious or feel defensive/embarrassed. I am totally oblivious to stuff like that and it weirdly makes me more confident (although I am the introvert and she the extrovert). I want her to get to that point too!

Plus my track record is pretty crazy, for example my main day job has experienced 66% YoY growth from a previous 8% trajectory for their eCommerce sales (not to mentioned 680% increase in direct leads) - pretty much the same story with my freelance clients too, all from a wide range of industries - eg,my regular clients include an aircraft parts manufacturer, antique dealer, corporate HR firm and a coffee house.\nIt's like I'm stuck in a continuous self-improvement loop (which I think is the turbulent nature of my personality - always self analyzing) and if a career doesn't fulfill my need to learn and develop both my creativity and my logical/strategic side, I move on. Also, I've had employers take liberties on my work ethic in the past, and just pile on more and more responsibilities and constantly move KPI goal posts with no additional support or remuneration (which is actually the situation I am in currently). \nBeing INTJ, my career has always been hampered by my social inadequacies - I don't do traditions,  I'm shit at thinking on the fly and I can come across a bit flat, I also have a nasty habit of under selling myself (ie when talking about my work I will hyper focus on what I could have done better rather than focusing on what I've achieved - I am working on this though). During meetings I appear as disengaged - which is never the case, as I like to think before I speak.\nIt frustrates me that my apparent lack of enthusiasm is in complete contrast with how fascinated I am by the industry I am in, and I spend every spare moment outside of work and family time researching - my idea of a good evening is watching a 3 hour long tutorial on building out a marketing funnel and then being so enthused that I end up spending a further 3 hours building it myself (queue going to bed at 3am, waking up for work at 7am - this happens at least once a week).\nAnyway, I'm rambling now - I just wanted to see if there are any others out there as weird as me, and with a similar back story?\n\n"}, {"title": "Ever had the one that got away?

If any one could shed some light on my situation or share their experience about this. I would be greatful.\nP.s Just a heads up that I am always the main guy for planning and indepth research work in our projects and hence understand that I am uniquely gifted.

When Im not good enough for his standarts, he takes it as his personal failure and i have to be punished.\nMy mother is the most touchy-feely person I ever known. She wants to hug and kiss and want to know what happended to me. Why am i quiet. If am i angry at her. When I am not , why I am frowning when I walk by street.\nMy sister is the sun. Always shining, smiling happy 14, who doesnt care about anything. She keeps talking and talking and going out with friends and i really love her.\nAt least I hope I do.\nBecause we really struggles about everything, literally every day. They dont understant that i like to be in my room, alone and reading books. That I love my piano more than doing small-talk with them. That i hate that stupid romcoms theyre watching in evenings and that i sucks in social interaction. And that i really dont need more friends.\nWe have an arguments, on daily basis, and I am so exhausted.\nMy mom always cries, she is telling me I am not normal, that she dont deserve me and that nobody was ever that evil at her than i am. That nobody has ever hurt her like i do.\nShe is telling me I am autistic, because i dont like hugging her.\nOnce i almost started to hyperventilating and she called me a freak.\nAnd its repeating again and again.\nJust because i didnt cry at grandmother\u00b4s funeral. Just because I act like nothing happened after our disagreement.\nJust because when she asks if i know that they love me and then asks if i love her back, i can not say yes.\nJust because when mother of her friend died, i ask what she died of and said that that\u2019s what people do sometimes. Die I mean. I suposse i should be sorry for her or something?\nAnd thats why im so scared. I know i have feelings, because every their word hurts me and sometimes i cry in good book when nobody is around me and theres places in the world i like but when i see her crying, i dont feel anything. Im not sad, angry, happy just tired.\nAnd when i see a baby in the street, which fell on the ground and cry, im just annoyed.\nIm scared, because i dont want to die alone, because it feels like some people are not meant to be loved, when thay cant love you back.\nBut it feels like theres nothing i can do with that either.\nI think theres something wrong with me and the worst is that i dont mind.\nThree days ago, we had a scary episode in which end my father told me he will contact a psychologist.\nAnd i realized, that theres nothing i can lost.\nBut when i talked to my mother yesterday morning she told me that if somebody of our family would needed a psychologist, they would contact him before.\nBut i actually realy liked that idea of talking to someone, even if i am not good at it and even writing this feel little wierd.\nBut i just want to be happy in my own way and live my own dreams and i know, that until i will live like this with my parents, i will just feel like i am broken.\nAnd thats all my fault.\nJust somebody tell me, what to do. Please. Should I contact a psychologist on my own?\n\n"}, {"title": "Intj here, how do you guys cope with super annoying people?

Of course it is not an all encompassing reality. We are all different because we all experienced life in a different way, culture, environment, teachings, and interests.

I was not expecting that when I posted this morning. I posted a new section about personal development and financial success strategies hope these help as well.\nEdit4: People are saying I mistyped Elon Musk so I listed some other INTJ in history/present as an example. Stephen Hawking, Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Arnold Schwarzenegger...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTJ Specifics...\n- I'm sure you are all too familiar with the social anxiety that comes from being this type as you are younger. You think differently, you don't understand social conventions and probably think most of it is downright stupid. Don't worry you will grow out of it. My tip is to try to say yes to any social gathering, going is 80% of the work. A good way to think about this is always in the terms of personal development. Interpersonal and social skills is highly relevant to boosting your career and opportunities in life.\n- You are not a robot. You feel emotions intensely probably more than most types. The reason you feel like a robot is because you try to rationalize everything, even your own emotions. You need to utilize your emotion to drive your work ethic at times. The strangest thing is when I feel angry from some kind of failure I try to channel that into bursts of productivity. Sometimes you need to learn how to be present in the moment this is especially relevant to relationships.\n- Hitting the gym early in the morning like around 5-7am every day will turn you into a literal human terminator. There is something called Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor. Essentially its a 20-30% boost to your ability to learn and think. During the evolution of the human being we were programmed to think better on the move. If you were being chased by a predator you'd hope your brain was firing off on all cylinders. The boost in testosterone and the confidence you get from having a better figure will make you highly confident. Confidence is an amazing ability as you will notice most people in life have deep self-esteem issues. Be confident in your INTJ-ness.\n- I know its fun to dream but eventually if you want to turn that into reality you have to execute. Think about the end goal the big picture, then just go out and execute immediately. INTJ are great at figuring things out as we go. We are able to derive patterns from everything we experience in life so have more life experiences.\n- It is ok to fail, even repeatedly. You can't go anywhere in life without failing. I think for our type it is especially painful since we care quite a lot about winning and often jealous of other people's success. Think of failure as the natural progression towards success, learn why you failed, absorb that lesson and then move on to the next opportunity.\n- Try to take initiative and lead. Your natural ability to see the inefficiencies of every system, your creative + logical thought patterns, combined with a more developed social skill will make people want to follow you.\n- You are naturally an interesting person because of your differences. You might not notice this but your co-workers and acquaintances actually want to hang out with you. Give them a chance before giving them the wall.\n- Motivation will only get you so far. To achieve goals utilize discipline. Form good habits.\n- The most important thing as an individual is to see yourself a year back and go \"Yeah, I am a much better and improved person than last year\". Everyone has a different level of success don't stress too much and just be better than you were in the past.\nIf you need an example of a highly developed INTJ just look at what Stephen Hawking, Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Arnold Schwarzenegger is able to achieve. Cast away your insecurities and go after what you want in life. We are some of the most capable people on earth.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis post seems to be really helping people so I can share a bit more info on how I tackle personal growth and financial success.\n\u200b\nSelf Improvement and ways to think and structure your life...\n- Be in the state of constant improvement. There are many categories. Knowledge, money, career status, communication skills, fitness, obtaining hobbies, improving hobbies... and much more areas of life you can improve upon. There is nothing more satisfying in life when you realized how much you grown just a year ago.\n- Time is your most valuable asset in life. Use it wisely. Money comes and goes but once a second ticks over it is gone forever..\nLet's say you are traveling by train. The typical person would be playing some game on their phones but this is the perfect opportunity to learn things. While walking try to listen to podcasts. This may not seem like much but over time all the time you spend commuting it doubles over as learning.\n- Becoming motivated is hard. It is human nature to be lazy and complacent. Do not be like most people and become temporarily motivated by some motivational bullshit it doesn't work long term. Instead rely on discipline. One of the greatest ability of a human is the ability to adapt and grow accustomed to a set life style. Make sure that life style is one of personal growth.\nI use google calendar to stick to a rough schedule with a focus on self improvement. Either before you go to sleep or right when you wake up, plan your day. Investing in a smart watch is also a good idea. You have a lot of useful things right on your wrist saving some time.\n\u200b\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMoney...\n- Early on in life say less then 120k income or so, it is worth way more to spend money on career development then investing in any kind of asset.\n- For those with some spare cash. Learn about investing as soon as you can. Even if you only have a bit of money to spare each month the power of compounding interest will serve you well later in life. Money opens the door to personal freedom.\nThere are many styles to investing but the slow approach will serve most people the best. Look into value and dividend investing. I personally utilize an income focused investment strategy rather than relying on timing the market and luck. I do a lot of REITs, Dividend Aristocrat stocks, and rental properties.\n- Learn about tax advantage accounts. 401k. opening your own LLC, getting your own real estate license, Credit Card Churning, Deal websites apps like slickdeals/Honey, ect\n- Be cheap and stingy with most things. Only buy things that make you more productive and make sure you buy things that are of good quality so they last longer. Place all extra funds into investments, even that dollar sitting there will make a difference over a long time span.\nMy three golden rules in this order\n\nSpend money to make more money\nSpend money to make your self more productive\nSpend money to make your self happy\n\n- It is also ok to purchase things that are fun on occasion. Things that put you in a good mood makes you a more productive person. Just make sure to not buy toys that are above your means to pay.\n- It is also good idea to spend money on hobbies. Hobbies and interests makes you a more interesting person which will serve you well in your professional career.\n- If you can try to eliminate commuting to work. The cost and sanity savings here are significant.\n- It is ok to live with your parents rent free until you have enough to invest in a piece of real estate, be the landlord not the renter.

These are just some of my thoughts based on what I like:\n+ INTJs generally shy away from passive social outings like sitting around drinking and eating, though if there is some sort of fun activity involved then it perks our interest eg bowling, music jam etc. If that's the case, involve her as much as you can and be happy that you're on the same team. Don't try to over-control her strategy.\n+ If you're wondering where to take her on a date, make a list of the following and let her choose: arthouse movie, picnic,   art gallery / museum, drawing class etc. INTJs love to be surrounded by nature and art. If you can do both in a day, even better.\n+ Try not to be argumentative for the sake of it. INTJs actually don't care for 'arguments' but are open to respectful discussion. If you disagree on religion, for instance, let her TALK. If she goes on lockdown, you've lost her interest and respect.\n+ Never try to change something about her unless it's life threatening. Don't try to change her hair, her clothes, or her personality. If you don't like her outfit, be prepared to change yours first.\n+ Compliment her first on her wit and intellect before her aesthetic. INTJs don't mind being told occasionally they are 'pretty', but it shouldn't be the currency in your relationship. If you laugh at her jokes, that means SO MUCH more.\n+ INTJs don't really like receiving gifts, so don't stress about buying her flowers or expensive jewellery. However, make an effort by being on time and being in a good mood on your dates. Show you respect her, not how much money you have.\n+ If your INTJ wants to learn a difficult skill from you (like driving), you have to be SUPER patient and not patronising. Compliment her small achievements. Sometimes the physical world eludes us, but given time, we will become super awesome at it.\n\n"}, {"title": "Can we stop posting posts about not posting posts like \"can we stop posts\"?

It got me thinking about how our beliefs change over time due to experience or getting wiser, or being taught something that changed your perspective etc. \nThe one that stuck out to me was something i think i created (prob not) that goes like this; \"Do the least to achieve the most\". Basically it means whatever it is you are doing , be efficient as possible and use the least amount of resources to get the best ROI. Eg; spend the least money to earn the most money, invest the least time to achieve the max goal of that time, etc. Generally speaking this sounds logical and sound. However it has a flaw in that you are trying to do the least work possible instead of the most work possible. If the efficiency you have at the low end is theoretically the same at the high end then you should \"Do the most to achieve the mostest\" or however you would say it. This is also flawed though, because there is a psychological/mental aspect to work and achievement. Having worked hard at something and earning it is worth way more than being giving something. Eg; being handed a 1st place marathon medal when you came in 34th does not feel as good (if at all) as actually training hard and actually getting first. It feels like cheating , or that it was just given to you and you dont need to work hard if things are just always given to you and you end up not appreciating things. This sort of ties into the old daying; \" the journey is the destination\".\nWork in itself is an achievement. Therefore 'doing the least to achieve the most.' is terrible for a person. Work is satisfying and gives drive and ambition and goals and so on. Regardless if the work is shitty or tedious or whatever negative emotion you associate with work. The old addage of 'live to eat, not to work.' is along the same line , you should actually 'live to work, not to eat.' \nBeing efficient and doing the minimal creates a 'meh' baseline mentality and doesnt propel you further than you need and can also cause you to resent people, employers, the goverment, etc. \nMy new motto is (not really concise and catchy but )\"Work harder than you think you should, do more than you think you need.\" Even if you arent getting a great ROI on your work, your efforts alone creat eudymonic happiness. A satisfying baseline of life that feels more accomplished in whatever work you do. You are striving to be the best at whatever you are doing and in theory it opens up more doors and by proxy also covers the other old mottos of doing the least to achieve the most, or doing the most to achieve the mostest. \nSorry if i am rambling, i hope i got my point across.  I guess the TLDR is that trying to find the sneaky, or efficient, or cheating, or 'getting by' method of work and life is ultimately unfulling and evryone should just work hard as fuck.\n\n"}, {"title": "Parenting as an INTJ (self.intj)", "likes": "29", "comments": "47", "content": "I love my kids, I really do.

Because I never fit in, I experienced a lot of insecurities, and it took me a long time to come to terms with who I am and what I have to offer. I am pleased to report that I am now happier than ever, and unlike many other middle aged people, I have yet to see any signs of the dreaded midlife crisis (and I don't expect any to develop). My life isn't perfect, but I wouldn't trade places with anyone else in the world at this point. I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on achieving happiness with my fellow INTJs, in the hopes that some of you will find it useful.\nI've researched some other people's perspectives on happiness, and I think we INTJs define it a little differently. For example, more extroverted people consider things like a sense of community, providing value to others, a large group of friends, a busy social life, and experiences (parties, travel, etc.) to be key contributors to their happiness. However, as an introvert, community isn't something that I find all that important (other than for basic things like public infrastructure and safety). In my job, I provide value to others as a means to an end, but it isn't a source of personal satisfaction for me. I don't care about having a large social circle because I only have time for a few select close friends, and I don't mind spending time alone (I enjoy being with my SO or my family when I'm not alone). As far as experiences are concerned, as an INTJ my mind is constantly filled with thoughts, so I have less of a need for external stimuli to keep me preoccupied. In fact, I enjoy many mundane solitary activities (listening to music, working out) as it gives me a chance to think about and reflect on things.\nHaving said that, I've found there are three primary areas that I need to focus on and maintain in order to achieve long term happiness.\n\nPhysical health/fitness. Keeping our bodies healthy and fit is not only important for optimal function, but it can also serve as a source of confidence for INTJs since it is one of the few external visual cues that non-INTJs can see. I've maintained my health and fitness since my 20s, and it's particularly satisfying to know that I am capable of the level of discipline and dedication required to achieve a challenging long term goal.\nFinancial health. As an INTJ, I value the freedom to be able to pursue my interests. In our current society, that means having money as it buys freedom and security. Here is why I think it's important to pursue financial independence, and here is how I'm achieving it.\nEmotional health. INTJs are normally logical beings, however we tend to struggle with emotions which can be completely irrational. Emotional issues, if left unchecked, can grow and manifest into physical and financial problems. In the past I used to try to deal with my feelings on my own or with friends, but that wasn't always productive due to a lack of knowledge or objectivity. As an adult I've found it helpful to consult a qualified professional when I'm struggling with emotional issues. Don't be embarrassed to work with a qualified therapist or counselor if you feel overwhelmed, and don't be afraid to utilize your employer's employee assistance program if they offer one.\n\nI believe that as long as I'm physically, financially, and emotionally healthy, I can deal with most of life's challenges and remain happy. Here are a few more tips for achieving/optimizing your happiness:\n\nFocus your time and energy on the things that are within your control. Worrying about stuff you can't do anything about leads to wasted time and unnecessary stress.\nAvoid social media, as it can lead to comparing your life against an unrealistic portrayal of other people's (since you're most likely seeing the highlight reels of their lives).\nLearning to be content and appreciating the little things are important for happiness, but some people struggle with this because they live in a bubble--which amplifies their problems. A good way to counter this is by volunteering to help the less fortunate. Being around those who are doing without will cause you to be more grateful of your own circumstances, and make it less likely for you to take your life for granted.\nAccept that you will have good and bad experiences in life. We wouldn't be able to appreciate the good if we never experience the bad. Try to learn from the bad experiences and grow from them, and don't forget them so that you can always keep a balanced perspective.\n\nEdit: Thank you /u/east-wrest for the gold!\n\n"}], [{"title": "Anyone act charismatic to counteract your awkwardness?

NOTE these are not traits OF INTJS but are related to the traits of being an INTJ. All of these traits I find to be day-to-day headaches that complicates my life more than it needs to be. Side-note, I acknowledge I am not the best with conveying my thoughts into words accurately, but please bear with me.\n1) If I used one word to describe my mind it would be: duality. I am decisively indecisive. If I have not already set it in stone, my thoughts will argue until it finally does, it can never just be \"let it be\". I am always at conflict with myself, which is not always bad, but sometimes it gets far too chaotic for any sane person. Hell, my username came from my conflicting nature!\n2) I always need to add emotion to my conversation. I'm pretty seemingly stoic, unless I truly care for the discussion. I am always aware to add emotion and correcting my wording in a way that won't be seen as blunt and/or insensitive. Even then, people tend to notice my very direct sense of thinking.\n3) I am brutally honest. I am direct to the meat of the topic and I do not sugarcoat it, unless I see it as an actual need. And when I do sugarcoat, I will do so as minimally as I see is necessary. This is a result of lacking an emotional connection most of the time\n4) Related to 1, I act detached, but really I feel emotions very strongly (following logic of course). As a child my emotions were too strong for me to control, it was easy to elicit a very strong emotional reaction (especially crying). It was a genuine problem, the lack of control caused me many problems with socializing with others my age. I obviously have much more control over my emotions now, but I still feel emotions very strongly at times, I just show it far less than before.\n5) I am my biggest critic, nobody can bring me down worse than I can. It could be the tiniest of details, but I will think of it as a big failure all the same. This has caused me to be self conscious about every little detail about myself (this list is a pretty damn good example of that) that most would not even give a thought to.\n6) I can never just enjoy something, I always have to analyze it. I will have to force myself to not think and just relax if I'm not trying to be serious, which doesn't always work.\n7) When I think, I'm usually thinking of something big, like say nature of humanity and all that jazz. Can't I just take a chill pill and think about things normal for a 19 year old?\n8) I am knowledgeable in many areas, but I do not have great knowledge on many of them. I intensively study something and then once I am satisfied, I archive the summary and remove the details. This gets pretty annoying when I get deeper into a discussion on that topic and I just can't accurately back up my thoughts as I would like.\nEdit: Some mistakes I caught long afterwards \n\n"}, {"title": "Nietzsche's Most INTJ Quotes (self.intj)", "likes": "75", "comments": "26", "content": "I love Friedrich Nietzsche (he's probably my favorite philosopher), and as many of you may be aware, he was a straight-up INTJ.

I am a successful attorney in my young 30s, writing to offer a more mellow INTJ perspective. I find myself not identifying with many of the negative posts here. I probably would have identified with them more when I was younger. Here are some thoughts that you may or may not find useful:\n\u00a0\nI consider the Harvey quote in the title to be words to live by, especially for INTJs. I was the smart kid in grade school. I turned in my assignments before everyone else. I quietly read for fun rather than interact with my classmates. \"Smart\" was my defining characteristic. \"Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.\"\n\u00a0\nDuring college and law school I made a conscious choice to do the following:\n\u00a0\n(1) Live a life of joy rather than pessimism or cynicism;\n(2) Try to bring joy to others;\n(3) Make people laugh;\n(4) Learn about other people's stories; and\n(5) Be willing to share my own story with others.\n\u00a0\nThere's more to it but that is just off the top of my head. Over the past decade or so, the positive change in my life has been enormous. I enjoy meeting people, experiencing new things, cheering people up, getting to know people better. I am known as a pleasant, cheerful person.\n\u00a0\nUnderneath it all, my INTJ mind still chugs away constantly. I sometimes finding myself thinking negative, cynical, sarcastic, or otherwise unpleasant thoughts. I make a conscious decision not to verbalize them. Because actions shape thoughts, as well as vice-versa, I have found my outlook truly changing for the better over the years. I think every INTJ is entitled to his or her own thoughts, but we do have a responsibility to make sure our actions (particularly speech) help rather than hurt others.\n\u00a0\nWhat inspired the change? First, I have personally known older INTJs who made the choice to cultivate social skills, kindness, and humor. It worked very well for them. Second, I was inspired by characters from stories: Vash the Stampede from Trigun. Elwood P. Dowd from Harvey. Captain Picard. Carrot from the Discworld stories.\n\u00a0\nIntelligence does not have to be your defining characteristic. You can still be super smart, capable, and extremely powerful in your own way. But at the same time, you can choose to be pleasant, kind, and truly interested in others. This will improve your life.\n\u00a0\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading.\n\u00a0\nP.S.: Socializing is still tiring. I still need alone time to recharge. Few things make me happier than finding other INTJs, in real life, and thinking, \"Oh my God I can finally relax with people like me. We can use big words without hesitation and discuss abstract topics, as happy as pigs in the mud on a hot summer day.\" I am still an INTJ. But that's not all I am.\n\n"}, {"title": "A short list of reminders (self.intj)", "likes": "103", "comments": "46", "content": "Last night I wrote down a sort of instruction manual for myself with behaviors/tendencies I need to be aware of and work on (some of it is fairly tongue-in-cheek). Perhaps some of you can identify with the things I've written, so I thought I would share. Please share your own personal rules in the comments if you feel so inclined. The following list is addressed to myself: \n1) Don't make snap judgments about people. You didn't like a lot of the most important people in your life at first, so don't continue to make that mistake. \n2) Ask for help and don't be ashamed of ignorance. After all, it's more efficient.\n3) When/if you realize someone is a potential interest, dive in and get to know them. Resist the urge to sit back and analyze them. By the time you decide for sure if you're interested, they will have long moved on.\n4) Remember to smile and/or have a pleasant and open countenance and posture. \n5) When the urge to be creative overcomes you, don't try to make something artistically pure or perfect, just make something \"good enough.\" Try to make something with the intent of selling it or as a gift for someone else, otherwise, you will obsessively ponder the philosophical truths underlying aesthetics, art, and reality itself, and enter a spiral of existential crises. \n6) Do not excise people from your life simply because you don't think they can help you. You will be wrong frequently, and wish you had them as a resource. \n7) However, you should excise people from your life if they hold you back from your goals.\n8) Don't get frustrated that many people are illogical. After all, that this quality makes them easier to manipulate (I'm half joking here). \n9) Don't lie to yourself to protect you ego and self image. This is your knee-jerk reaction, so be mindful of it.\n10) Never research anything to do with abstract physics when you have an important deadline coming up. It will feel like the most important issue (which it might very well be... on a cosmic scale) and will attempt to consume your mind and prevent you from studying. \n11) Speak up, make an effort, and be heard. It's not as easy to express your thoughts as it is to think them, but it's often worth it. \n12) Most other people are more sensitive than you are. Initiate pleasantries and other exchanges to make them happy. Also, go easy on the edgy jokes.\n13) Limit your teasing. Just because you know someone well doesn't mean you have license to pick on them--this hurts people sometimes. Encourage them as much as possible.\n14) Forgive yourself for not being perfect. You're not going to be. Give yourself a break every now and then.\n\n"}, {"title": "How do you respond when you feel someone is \"handling\" you using Fe?

The following will be eventually added to the wiki as a permanent reference, and members of this sub are welcome to contribute now and in the future.\nIt comes as no surprise to most subscribers here that a lot of INTJs experience similar personality-related difficulties and frustrations in life, nor that other types have some frequent common questions related to understanding/relating to the INTJs in their lives.  Anyone who has spent much time on the sub has seen certain questions and topics come up periodically - some even as often as a near-weekly basis.  \nIn an effort to give a more consolidated set of resources regarding these topics, below is a list of several of the most common ones, including links to relevant threads (chosen for this list according to the extent of discourse/advice given within them) and, where such a thing is possible, short summaries of commonly-given answers and advice that may be found in those threads. \nOn Life as an INTJ\nVery few of us completely fit the stereotypes!\nWhat is the meaning of life?  A thread, another thread \n\nTLDR: Most (though not all) of us have to create our own meaning.  There are a lot of different specific ways people go about that.\n\nDifficulty dealing with difficult emotions and overthinking things. \nDifficulty picking a college major\nCareer advice from fellow INTJs\nHandling the necessity to deal with people more than is comfortable in one\u2019s day-to-day \nExperience of being a female INTJ \n\nTLDR: There are some common experiences unique to female INTJs due to the personality type\u2019s clashing with the cultural norms and expectations surrounding Western femininity.  Far more detail available on the 2X_INTJ sub. \n\nWhat types of music do INTJs like?\n\nTLDR: All kinds.  Music preferences don\u2019t seem to have much or anything to do with MBTI, but we have a good time swapping recommendations anyway\u2026\nThread 1\nThread 2\nThread 3\nThread 4\n\nProductivity\nINTJs are prone to having a large variety of interests, some of which we will pursue to the level of obsession.  But many of us also experience difficulty in pushing our ideas and plans and projects to completion, whether they are necessary for school or work, or simply chosen on our own.\nWhen I\u2019m stressed out, I get nothing done.  And when I get nothing done, I get even more stressed \nWhat are some good organizational tools/methods that people use? \nGeneral Interpersonal Communication\nSmooth and effective communication is a skill like any other - it\u2019s rare that it comes very naturally to INTJs (at least, in communicating with people of other types), and there are several common themes:\nHandling small talk gracefully\nThings I say don\u2019t tend to come out how I mean them\nBeing argumentative, being persuasive, and how those are frequently not the same thing\nReading nonverbal cues that indicate interest from others\nFriendships\nHow do I better go about making (1) them? (2)\nHow do I make them more satisfying and less superficial?\nHow do I maintain them once I\u2019ve got them?\nRomantic relationships\nWhile this is a big topic of concern on the sub, it should be noted that many INTJs are comfortable in their lives without romantic relationships, and a theme not currently represented in the links below is that many of us feel social pressure to pursue such relationships when we may not care that much about them.  \nWhat INTJs wished they\u2019d known before they started dating\nOther general relationship advice\nDifficulty forming deep connections in dating \nReading cues and working up the confidence to make a move \nDating ENFPs, specifically \nExperiences with INTJ-INTJ relationships \nPainful breakups \nDifficulty as a female INTJ (all generally applicable advice, but this thread specifically contains a lot of stories from INTJ ladies)\nNon-INTJs Relating to INTJs\nINTJs\u2019 tendency toward outward stoicism, extreme independence, dislike of talking \u201cjust to talk,\u201d and bluntness sometimes makes it a unique challenge for other types to be comfortable around us, particularly in romantic/dating scenarios.\nWhat kinds of special things could I do to celebrate a special occasion with my INTJ SO?\nIs this INTJ interested in me?  What about this one?\n\nTLDR: If you\u2019re not already a serious couple and the INTJ is voluntarily interacting with you, they at the very least like you platonically.  If you think they\u2019re flirting, more likely than not, you\u2019re right.\n\nProblems in a relationship with an INTJ\nFemale INTJs and social norms in dating \n\nTLDR: Ew, social norms.\n\n\n"}, {"title": "What's your latest obsession?
