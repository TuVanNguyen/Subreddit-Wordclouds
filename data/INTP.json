This is something that I will work on this week.  \nEvery once in a while there's a flare up of people asking for hands on moderation.\nI've said this from the very start when I was brought on as a moderator to do garbage duty with the spam queue and to add to the sidebar:\nI really don't care to police content, nor do I think omfgninja does.  There is no reason to on reddit; that's literally the whole point of the site and the reason user voting is such a popular format for content/discussion on the internet for the past few years.  It allows everyone to feel a degree of control and relevance regardless of whether they participate or contribute directly.  Invariably the content which is most popular with the largest amount of people will be the most successful. \nIf it really bothers you that someone is shitposting, or saying something that really rambles your jambourines, all it takes is 5 of you to downvote it and then no one else will have to see those hurtful words on their computer monitors.\nIf there is obvious spam, report it and I will 9/10 times see it within a day.  That's the most control I would ever see necessary for a select few people to have over the content on a broad discussion subreddit like this.

I think our interpretation of other's words isn't moderated by anything like 'truth', but rather I think it's largely influenced by how much we can empathise with the other person's opinion. No matter how logical one might feel their argument is, I think it's fundamentally indistinguishable from stupidity to those whose worldviews differ too greatly from your own. For this reason, thinking that people should agree with you because you feel you have a logical argument alone does little but cause friction. I think we feel anger towards those we disagree with simply because we cannot see how they could ever believe what we think they believe, and so I don't think the solution is to argue with them and try to change their mind through spewing one's opinion at them, but rather the only solution I see is to open-mindedly seek to understand their point of view. I don't think that the idea that \"they're wrong\" exists, you just personally fail to understand their point of view. If you feel you can empathise with them but still disagree with them, the only thing you can do is explain why you personally don't feel like you can agree, but this doesn't need any frustration or anger. Being honest, I wrote this to just clarify my own thoughts but I'll post it to see what you guys think. I'm desperately trying to figure out a way to avoid getting angry at people I'm talking with which I feel just leads to each person talking to themselves, and I think this is the best way to rationalise it. The idea of spewing ideas at each other which you're not trying to understand is the game I don't think anyone should be playing.\n\n"}, {"title": "Has any other INTP ever had a fictional affair with a stranger totally within their head?

(self.INTP)", "likes": "3", "comments": "2", "content": "So I've figured some things out about myself and to start, I've broken some up activities into a few categories:\nTechnical: Learning guitar, Taking apart a computer and putting it back together, Untying a knot\nSocial: Tabling for an organization, Listening to people's problems (ie. customer service-type stuff), Generally socializing \nBoth+Theoretical: Cooking, Language learning, Consuming media and writing analyses\n\u200b\nWith the more technically oriented activities, I have found that I can do them, and I can do them very well, (aside from certain process-oriented flaws like my perfectionist/completionist tendencies where I will focus too much on one particular part of the task and forget to move on or pace myself) but just because I am skilled and have the ability to doesn't mean it translates to enjoyment, quite the opposite actually, it's more of a numbness. I find extended, technical, object oriented tasks like deconstructing and reconstructing a computer for instance, force me to sit in this kind of hollowness I do not enjoy. I remember one time I was untying a knot in a piece of metal chain jewelry and I looked at the clock and around 45 minutes had passed. I go into this hyper focused Flow State in which I am able to do the task very well but I sort of disappear in a sense, and this is not fulfilling. Upon exiting I just feel like i'm in a sort of daze instead of any sort of tangible fulfillment, even if I had a good reason it just doesn't always feel 'worth it'.\n\u200b\nThe exact opposite happens when I do tasks in the social category. I can perform them and I do have a sort of inherent desire to, as I find I am extremely empathetic and tend to consciously attempt to listen-to-understand instead of filtering conversation through my own desires and biases, as I see far too often, but I usually feel overwhelmed quite quickly. The strain of trying to juggle: avoiding social faux pas, not hurting people's feelings, trying to constantly deconstruct people's true intentions/hints, keeping the speaker-listener ratio balanced, being hyper aware of my appearance and body language, and so much more is emotionally (and egotistically?) exhausting, and I am not super proficient in it in practice. Noticing why people do what they do doesn't necessarily translate into being able to handle those situations efficiently, suavely and charismatically.\n\u200b\nThey both make me feel as though I'm only using 'half of my brain' in a sense, and are never necessarily rewarding. But I seem to have have found the balance in activities like language learning, cooking, and writing media analyses.\nI found the reason that language learning is so natural and enjoyable to me is because of how dynamic it is. Dynamic in that it has the perfect balance of social, theoretical and technical processes. I can contemplate subtle nuances in human communication in order to understand the difference between synonyms, delve deep into grammar as a sub-system of communication and figure out how it works because it is interesting, I can emotionally and (socio-?)scientifically engage in media of different cultures, I can study people's idiosyncrasies and idiolects to understand what, why, and how they are talking, I can analyze social context and philosophies etc. Cooking is similar in that I get very clear personal and interpersonal gratification through physical pleasure, as well as the ability to endlessly experiment and integrate technical knowledge (cook times, flavor combinations, etc.) to a direct application. Same with media analyses, writing theories and thematic/character analyses, and comparing and discussing my ideas with others is very natural to me.\nI've been able to deduce that I really do enjoy socialization, and it is the foundational focus of pretty much everything I am interested in, but I like to engage in a more removed, technical-theoretical way. \n\u200b\nThe problem at the moment is monetizability and how to achieve that. \nMy brain is made for coding. I do not want to code. \nI can not handle constant socialization.\nI pursed BAs in Writing and Communications because it made the most sense, but they have, as expected, only done so much, as I still feel rather unbalanced.\nSo how do I find those fulfilling, full-brain-and-heart in-betweens that actively and fully engage me?\nI've never been privy to the 'find your passion' and understand it is more about making one, nor do I agree with the complacent \"you don't have to enjoy what you do\" as now I've finally understood how I am fulfilled and want to pursue that to sustain myself. I just want to not be miserable, stuck doing something that only uses 'one half of my brain' in that sense. Or even worse, a bastardized technical version of the things that should be enjoyable (line cook for instance).

Their argument, \"oh, people can change over time, but that's just their iNfeRiOr fUncTIons dEVelOPing.\" Well, my friend who lacks critical thinking, if one can develop their inferior functions, what is stopping them from developing those and neglecting their superior functions to the point where their inferior ones become what is natural to them, and superior become unnatural? The problem is that people, even intuitives, are stuck in their ways to the point where they will never change. INTPs will keep utilizing Ti Ne because that is what's comfortable to them, so why change amirite? Hop on the Ti Ne bandwagon at a young age, Si and Fe therefore feel uncomfortable to increase later. Your personality type can change to the point where it's natural to be another type, it's just hard. Don't know why this is so controversial.\nAnother point I may address some other time is the newbies who think everyone only has 4 functions. Every person has every function. Even ExTPs utilize Fi (in fact, higher Fi than of course ExTJ, despite ExTJ \"haVInG fi\"). Because of this, an INTP can become an ESFP despite \"sharing none of the functions\" as people would say. Very extreme example of course, it would be a very rare occurrence because of the huge differences between these types. Still possible. People even say INTP and ESFJ aren't opposites because \"thEY shARe tHe sAmE fUnCTIons.\" Umm, no, the INTP likes using Ti Ne whereas ESFJ hates their use, and vice versa.

He said we should not make it awkward and stay good friends. However, since that day he has completely changed for the better. He initiates contact everyday for us to get together, has opened up more than ever about his future/feelings, and is all around just kinder to me. There's a chance we may not see each other again and he has admitted he is sad to leave me, but he has said multiple times he could never do long distance (I think is honestly the reason he did not want to move forward). \nThe thought of never seeing him again is overwhelming, and I guess I just want to reiterate to him how important he is to me and how much I care about him.

(self.INTP)", "likes": "2", "comments": "2", "content": "So, first of all, I'm not that sure about being an INTJ or an INTP and that's mostly because of my approach to studying and related things to it.\nI was quite good at HS, my average was an A when I finished it but the way I did was quite weird.So, in middle school, I didn't skip many classes, at least as far as I remember and I was rather a C/B student than an A student. I got how things worked fully by the time I entered my HS, well, I always knew how they were but I just decided to change my attitude to it. My school didn't care that much about the attendance rate but about their student's grade rate, so I decided to skip pretty much often, I skipped like 30-35% of my last school year. First of all, I found it quite easy to study subjects at high school, so anytime I attended classes I answered them, sometimes without preparing, sometimes studying during the class or just before it. Everything was relatively easy, even exams were so. I was sitting rather in the first row or in the last: In the first case because I wanted to interact with my teacher well, in the second case because 2 of my friends were always sitting there. The reason why I was skipping was that I hated going there, I didn't hate the process of sitting there and just being there, I didn't hate my school itself. I just hated that I have to waste my time on it because I could do other things that were more interesting to me and I could simply better take some sleep than going there. I was self-teaching myself. I sure knew I wanted to enter university so I was preparing on my own. I never learnt English at my school, in middle school I got a C on that but when I started learning it on my own I easily got an A. I prepared for all my exams on my own and got As on them. My parents decided to send me to additional lessons with private teachers but I hated the idea and eventually managed to talk them out from that.\nSo I managed to enter one of the top unis in my country so I felt rather happy about it but I wasn't that glad about my majors. It's regional science while I'd like to code more. Anyways, I took first weeks quite serious to understand how It works and what I will do and It seemed the same as easy as It was in my HS. I sit rather in the first or the second row, the same reason as It was. I skip a lot, uni stated that students mustn't skip more than 36h in a term but I realized It was not that true. If my grades are fine and I don't skip too much, I'm safe. So I skipped about 60h-70h in my first midterm and nothing happened, I closed my exams A-B-A-A. But It's this year, I actually entered my uni a year before but I took a year off because I was stupid, I won't deny it. My grades were fine and I skipped pretty the same but I was failing my german language, although anything would tell It was that big of a problem but I felt depressed that year, there were reasons for that but still It was rather stupid. After that, I started feeling insecure as hell about studying: I always feel like I can be expelled and that's really not on my plan. This year my grades are fine but my new language class (which is Korean) makes me feel insecure, that's the only subject I got a bad grade (E). I still don't study for my classes pretty much at all and especially since It's online classes now. I always cheat on or slam off everything I'm given to do. I do that because I know It'll work. I knew how to trick on the anti-plagiarism system so all my papers are not actually mine but the system never found it out so I got all As on them. I always find short-ways to do my homework, like, I do my Korean home literally just translating things in google, changing some words to those that are supposed to be used (I just cntr+F our book) and then give it to Koreans in a discord server to check it. I actually did my translation test exactly like that I got my first C+ on Korean (before It was F-D). I realize I should study it and I do but It's not that easy, unfortunately, so I set up a plan that I have to study Korean every day for 2 hours. I'm just bad at memorizing stuff from doing the same thing again and again (remote memory), I wouldn't say that I get things through practicing either. I understand it conceptually, I know-how It should be but because of not remembering all stuff at once I suck at it.\nSo I know what I want from it, I wouldn't say I don't care about my grades (although I often say it irl but more in an ironic way). I'd even say I want to be an A student but because of my Korean and PE, oh yes, I forgot about PE classes, yes, they also influence our grade and they're obligatory, the attendance rate is the grade of this crappy subject and what do you think I got on that? a D for sure. So due to some reasons, my average in the first midterm was a C++. I also code and I strive for learning it fully and I want to try it as a job. So I want to do completely not what I'm studying but I'll still do that to feel safe. It's due to many reasons I planned for my future.\nAbout how I sit in classes, well, usually I dream away and my attention is the worst thing here. Even if I try to focus, later on, I forget about focusing. I might have ADHD but I don't think I will see some therapy.\nYet I forgot to mention how I hate PE, that's just pointless for me and that's all.\nSo that's pretty much it. Would you relate to it?

I think our interpretation of other's words isn't moderated by anything like 'truth', but rather I think it's largely influenced by how much we can empathise with the other person's opinion. No matter how logical one might feel their argument is, I think it's fundamentally indistinguishable from stupidity to those whose worldviews differ too greatly from your own. For this reason, thinking that people should agree with you because you feel you have a logical argument alone does little but cause friction. I think we feel anger towards those we disagree with simply because we cannot see how they could ever believe what we think they believe, and so I don't think the solution is to argue with them and try to change their mind through spewing one's opinion at them, but rather the only solution I see is to open-mindedly seek to understand their point of view. I don't think that the idea that \"they're wrong\" exists, you just personally fail to understand their point of view. If you feel you can empathise with them but still disagree with them, the only thing you can do is explain why you personally don't feel like you can agree, but this doesn't need any frustration or anger. Being honest, I wrote this to just clarify my own thoughts but I'll post it to see what you guys think.

I think it's absolutely stupid when people say one's personality can't change. Their argument, \"oh, people can change over time, but that's just their iNfeRiOr fUncTIons dEVelOPing.\" Well, my friend who lacks critical thinking, if one can develop their inferior functions, what is stopping them from developing those and neglecting their superior functions to the point where their inferior ones become what is natural to them, and superior become unnatural? The problem is that people, even intuitives, are stuck in their ways to the point where they will never change. INTPs will keep utilizing Ti Ne because that is what's comfortable to them, so why change amirite? Hop on the Ti Ne bandwagon at a young age, Si and Fe therefore feel uncomfortable to increase later. Your personality type can change to the point where it's natural to be another type, it's just hard. Don't know why this is so controversial.\nAnother point I may address some other time is the newbies who think everyone only has 4 functions. Every person has every function. Even ExTPs utilize Fi (in fact, higher Fi than of course ExTJ, despite ExTJ \"haVInG fi\"). Because of this, an INTP can become an ESFP despite \"sharing none of the functions\" as people would say. Very extreme example of course, it would be a very rare occurrence because of the huge differences between these types. Still possible. People even say INTP and ESFJ aren't opposites because \"thEY shARe tHe sAmE fUnCTIons.\" Umm, no, the INTP likes using Ti Ne whereas ESFJ hates their use, and vice versa. You know what fuck this MBTI bullshit I'm going for a walk.\nTL;DR: Your natural personality can change, it just takes getting out of the comfort zone for a while.

(self.INTP)", "likes": "3", "comments": "2", "content": "So I've figured some things out about myself and to start, I've broken some up activities into a few categories:\nTechnical: Learning guitar, Taking apart a computer and putting it back together, Untying a knot\nSocial: Tabling for an organization, Listening to people's problems (ie. customer service-type stuff), Generally socializing \nBoth+Theoretical: Cooking, Language learning, Consuming media and writing analyses\n\u200b\nWith the more technically oriented activities, I have found that I can do them, and I can do them very well, (aside from certain process-oriented flaws like my perfectionist/completionist tendencies where I will focus too much on one particular part of the task and forget to move on or pace myself) but just because I am skilled and have the ability to doesn't mean it translates to enjoyment, quite the opposite actually, it's more of a numbness. I find extended, technical, object oriented tasks like deconstructing and reconstructing a computer for instance, force me to sit in this kind of hollowness I do not enjoy. I remember one time I was untying a knot in a piece of metal chain jewelry and I looked at the clock and around 45 minutes had passed. I go into this hyper focused Flow State in which I am able to do the task very well but I sort of disappear in a sense, and this is not fulfilling. Upon exiting I just feel like i'm in a sort of daze instead of any sort of tangible fulfillment, even if I had a good reason it just doesn't always feel 'worth it'.\n\u200b\nThe exact opposite happens when I do tasks in the social category. I can perform them and I do have a sort of inherent desire to, as I find I am extremely empathetic and tend to consciously attempt to listen-to-understand instead of filtering conversation through my own desires and biases, as I see far too often, but I usually feel overwhelmed quite quickly. The strain of trying to juggle: avoiding social faux pas, not hurting people's feelings, trying to constantly deconstruct people's true intentions/hints, keeping the speaker-listener ratio balanced, being hyper aware of my appearance and body language, and so much more is emotionally (and egotistically?) exhausting, and I am not super proficient in it in practice. Noticing why people do what they do doesn't necessarily translate into being able to handle those situations efficiently, suavely and charismatically.\n\u200b\nThey both make me feel as though I'm only using 'half of my brain' in a sense, and are never necessarily rewarding. But I seem to have have found the balance in activities like language learning, cooking, and writing media analyses.\nI found the reason that language learning is so natural and enjoyable to me is because of how dynamic it is. Dynamic in that it has the perfect balance of social, theoretical and technical processes. I can contemplate subtle nuances in human communication in order to understand the difference between synonyms, delve deep into grammar as a sub-system of communication and figure out how it works because it is interesting, I can emotionally and (socio-?)scientifically engage in media of different cultures, I can study people's idiosyncrasies and idiolects to understand what, why, and how they are talking, I can analyze social context and philosophies etc. Cooking is similar in that I get very clear personal and interpersonal gratification through physical pleasure, as well as the ability to endlessly experiment and integrate technical knowledge (cook times, flavor combinations, etc.) to a direct application. Same with media analyses, writing theories and thematic/character analyses, and comparing and discussing my ideas with others is very natural to me.\nI've been able to deduce that I really do enjoy socialization, and it is the foundational focus of pretty much everything I am interested in, but I like to engage in a more removed, technical-theoretical way. \n\u200b\nThe problem at the moment is monetizability and how to achieve that. \nMy brain is made for coding. I do not want to code. \nI can not handle constant socialization.\nI pursed BAs in Writing and Communications because it made the most sense, but they have, as expected, only done so much, as I still feel rather unbalanced.\nSo how do I find those fulfilling, full-brain-and-heart in-betweens that actively and fully engage me?\nI've never been privy to the 'find your passion' and understand it is more about making one, nor do I agree with the complacent \"you don't have to enjoy what you do\" as now I've finally understood how I am fulfilled and want to pursue that to sustain myself. I just want to not be miserable, stuck doing something that only uses 'one half of my brain' in that sense. Or even worse, a bastardized technical version of the things that should be enjoyable (line cook for instance).

Too cliche? How personal would you want it to be?? Would it make you feel like they cared???  Would you prefer verbal????  If the person has expressed previous feelings for you, would you find it too forward or awkward?????\n\u200b\nFor context, we\u2019ve known each other for years, but about a month ago I confessed my feelings for him and explained how I had never said it before because I did not want it to be awkward between us. He said we should not make it awkward and stay good friends. However, since that day he has completely changed for the better. He initiates contact everyday for us to get together, has opened up more than ever about his future/feelings, and is all around just kinder to me. There's a chance we may not see each other again and he has admitted he is sad to leave me, but he has said multiple times he could never do long distance (I think is honestly the reason he did not want to move forward). \nThe thought of never seeing him again is overwhelming, and I guess I just want to reiterate to him how important he is to me and how much I care about him.  I am not the best at expressing my feelings verbally, so I feel I would do better writing them down, but I don\u2019t want him to take it as some desperate attempt of me trying to manipulate him into feeling something more. Or for him to think I am being too sappy by writing a letter. As much as I care about him, I ultimately want him to be happy whether it's with me or someone else and I don\u2019t want him to think I am overly attached. \nAnyway, thank you for any advice and sorry for my overthinking rant... :)\n\n"}, {"title": "INTPs with INFJ SOs, how did you meet?

At the beginning of our relationship i was not completely sure I wanted to be with her, and after our first year together every now and then I used to wonder if I should break up with her. Our relationship lasted almost three years. \nIn the last sixth months we were completely different people. She developed her personality and began to frequent people I really didn\u2019t like, I was not comfortable around them, I felt like I was incapable of satisfying her new personality and those people around her were a constant reminder of how I was socially awkward and how I was a failure to the modern teenager. I have always been a young grandpa, I listen to old music all day, i don\u2019t like to go out, I don\u2019t consider myself boring but I don\u2019t do typical fun things. She wanted to go out more, she was always looking to get high, I like getting high, I actually convinced her to use marijuana for the first time, but for me it was a fun thing to do once in a while.\nAt the beginning of our relationship she told me a big secret about something terrible that happened to her, and i was fully supportive of her. Sometimes she would have these terrifying anxiety breakdowns and I always tried to protect her feelings. I knew she was in a lot of pain, so I tried not to bother her with my problems, that were significantly smaller than hers. But in the last six months I felt like I could complain about a few things every now and then. She used to tell me that that was annoying. I told her it didn\u2019t seem fair that I had always been there for her, but she wasn\u2019t willing to listen to my problems. \nIn the last 3 months of our relationship we decided to open our relationship. The idea seemed great, but I didn\u2019t considered that I have really bad social skills and that it would be really hard to get another girl. A second thing I didn\u2019t consider was that the kind of people she would open the relationship with were the very same kind of people that I couldn\u2019t stand (artsy, modern, fashionable, \u201cintellectual\u201d, Bohemian people). Throughout our open relationship she only made up with one guy and that was it. I remember it was New Year\u2019s Day and I was at my ex gf\u2019s place. my grandpa was in his deathbed, my grandpa lives across the country, so I wasn\u2019t able to be with him, however I read the family group chat and i thought well... I should be with my dad right now. I told her and I quote \u201cI should go home, my grandpa will die any minute now, i should be with my dad.\u201d And what did she do? She thought, hey, some free time I should go make out with that guy from my class.\nThat was a dick move, but I weren\u2019t the same supportive guy as 2 years ago. I didn\u2019t do it consciously but i made my ex gf feel like everything she liked was complete trash. The last thing we did together was a trip to New York (I\u2019m not from the US). Along with two other friends, we spend a week in NY, we had a really big fight because she wanted to look at some paintings at the MET, and there wasn\u2019t enough time, and i really preferred to see the antique weapons exhibit. I told her to go with her friend, she said I didn\u2019t care about what she likes. And it was true, but in the end we came back to the MET and saw the paintings, and we missed the UN building (I really wanted to go, I\u2019m a lawyer).\nI paid for the plane tickets and asked everyone to pay me back when they could. Eventually we broke up, she always held the moral high ground. She told me she was worried about me because in the very last day I called her to know where she was; she considered it was a toxic behavior. But the truth was that I felt really lonely and I just called her because my mind was overthinking about her being with other guys.  She called me toxic because of what I did the last day of our 3 year relationship, completely ignoring that for the last month she really didn\u2019t give a single fuck about me.\nAlmost a a week past our breakup, I asked her if she could give me the plane ticket money, and she said yes. I was saving for a trip I had planned in June. I created a terrible habit, from time to time I would check her Twitter and see what she was up to. Around May i asked her for the ticket money, and she got really mad. Her mother had invited me on her family trips, but since the NY trip was something we (broke, low wage, hard working students) planned without our parents help, i didn\u2019t thought it was rude to ask. She asked me how was I even capable of asking her for the ticket\u2019s money after her family had invited me to their trips. If I knew she would do that, I would had never accepted to go on her family trips. \nA few days after that I checked her twitter account and I saw she had a new boyfriend (after only three months after our 3 year relationship.) and it was hard. But it was harder to read her tweets saying, I love you, I had never been in love before. If she said that she had never been so in love, i wouldn\u2019t have paid it any mind. But it made me feel so angry, so sad. I was with her, she had whispered a million times I was the love of her life to my ear while we were as close as two people can be. So that was a fucking lie. \nI try not to check her social media but it\u2019s impossible, i don\u2019t miss her, i wouldn\u2019t come back to being on a relationship with her. But I don\u2019t know why I look for her tweets, i look at her photos. I think I\u2019m developing a drinking problem, it\u2019s almost 5 in the morning and i haven\u2019t got any sleep because im writing about this to a complete stranger.

DYOR\nI've had an add diagnosis since i was six years old, though i rejected it along with my supposed aspergers until i was 14 or 15. I still somewhat do, but back then my only reason for doing so was fear for being labeled as different, and wanting to be like others. It was only when i got to my senior year of high school that i actually tried to get a birds eye view and compare myself to my peers, and after half a year of studying Jung and doing self analysis it started to become clear that something was hindering me from performing at the probably average level of my classmates. People around me seemed to have this somewhat magic ability and energy to act in their self interest. It was beyond me how people would find time to knock out a four hour assignment, see their friends and practice their hobbies in the same day. Between the mindless web surfing and rituals of hedonistic escapism,  I was struggling to even sit down and collect my thoughts. When i found out about the mbti and got further into jungian typology, the line between my previous diagnosis and mere  trait started to blur. I might be suffering from a bit of confirmation bias as i like many others on this sub have a somewhat emotional/romantic connection to the intp type, but one thing that i have noticed that isn't purely anecdotal, is  that a lot of the people in this community deals with the same issues that i do, and some have it really bad. There was a post in here from a guy in deep depression, filled with regret and desperate for an explanation to his selfish escapist behaviour, worded as if it was too early to even ask for a solution. Suggestions on ascetic self help rituals like cold showers and nofap were the top if not all of the replied suggestions. I tried that too, but my methods always became simply another distraction from the problem itself. Nofap wasn't about gaining energy or confidence, it was about out-doing the community by seeing how long you could last. Diets, therapy, vigorous exercise and meditation fell short as well. About half a year ago i got into nootropics. i read a post on the r/afinil subreddit from a guy with similar problems who with the help of medication finally managed to take a step in the right direction. At the time i thought the idea of unprescribed medication was a bit of a far stretch. It felt like cheating. Like i had to take a shortcut because i failed to walk the righteous path of self-help. When i realized i didn't have much to loose i ordered a batch anyway. they sat on my desk for a week before i gave in to my curiosity. I was blind but now i see. It was like i had been freed from the restraints that previously kept me from making any sort of meaningful progress. Within a week, i had not only caught up to the 20 hours of undelivered assignments i had due, i had started talking to girls, and actually socializing with my classmates. People took notice and asked what was up, but i evaded the questions. This wonderful substance seemed to simply work with no strings attached except for tolerance. Half a year later i use them sparingly to avoid building up tolerance, but i have as much succes with them as i did back then, and im incredibly grateful for the help they did. What i guess i wanna say is that for all the people in here plagued by their avoidance, with numerous failed attempts at getting their shit together, the pills just work. It's that simple, at least in my case. Ive tried Adderall as well, but it makes me a bit neurotic.\nTLDR: If self help fails at helping you get your shit together, there is always medication.\n\n"}, {"title": "INTP Care and Handling Guide: (self.INTP)", "likes": "1166", "comments": "237", "content": "CONGRATULATIONS! An INTP has deemed you worthy of their time (at least for now\u2014 this is subject to change without warning). For new users, this manual will provide all of the basic information that you will need to take care of your new INTP unit.\nYour INTP unit will come with the following accessories:\nOne (1) outfit to be used for exercise, socializing, working, and sleeping\nOne (1) pair of over-ear headphones\nOne (1) laptop with browser optimized for 100+ tabs\nOne (1) mobile device (equipped with find-phone app in event of misplacement , GrubHub)\nOne (1) comfortable blanket (for forts, sleep, security)\nOne (1) first aid kit\nOne (1) box of photographs and sentimental objects\nOne (1) The \u2019How and Why\u2019 book of discussion prompts including but not limited to questions like \u2018How did incels come to be?\u2019 And \u2018Why do people sell LulaRoe?\u2019\nOne (1) extra-large whiteboard and a dry erase marker for aid in the communication/exploration of vast, abstract ideas\nOne (1) World Paradigm. Everything they know and understand fits into this model. There are no anomalies. This World Paradigm consists of several sub paradigms and many underlying theories.\nCustom Upgrades: Topic-Obsession packs like \u2018Myers Briggs\u2019 or \u2018Serial Killers\u2019. You can plug these in for your INTP unit to read, listen to, watch, mull over, categorize, and help them complete their World Paradigm\u2122\nSoftware:\nYour INTP will be programmed with the following traits;\nTi: Your INTP will work hard to have a complete understanding of a situation or problem. They may answer questions with more questions. It is best to answer honestly and to the best of your ability, being careful with semantics. Your INTP unit may take a bit of time to compile new information so be prepared to wait for an opinion or judgement. If you are unwilling to wait, you may receive an \u2018I don\u2019t know yet\u2019 error. A sure sign that your INTP is compiling is a glassy eyed stare in the middle of conversation. To interrupt the process, engage them directly and use eye contact to maintain their attention.\n\u200b\nNe: Your INTP unit is equipped with additional pattern-detecting processes and can identify causes behind behaviors, predict behaviors, and link seemingly unrelated ideas. Your INTP unit may only feel comfortable revealing their findings if prompted. To start the pattern-finding processes, try the following queries:\n\u201cnew name for a company that mines cryptocurrency, but farm-themed\u201d\n\u201cwhy did my tinder date tell me I wasn\u2019t funny after laughing at all my jokes\u201d\n\u200b\nSi: Your INTP\u2019s main process might hang due to their tendency to daydream. They may zone out and be remembering their last vacation. They may ruminate on an embarrassing thing they did two years ago at that NYE party. They may be fantasizing about what they would have said as President of the USA in that situation. Your INTP may tell you about a past event they experienced once or twice (or three or four times \u2026). But this also means that you can remind them of a past success or fun memory for a quick pick me up.\n\u200b\nFe: Your INTP may have trouble being patient with the needs of other people. If the Fe function is left unchecked your INTP unit will completely dismiss a person, cut contact or develop a simmering resentment of them. If your INTP unit is acting unreasonably selfish you can usually use obligation or guilt to turn them around. If they feel that they have been in the wrong your INTP will likely apologize.\n\u200b\nGetting Started\nTo turn on your new INTP unit:\n\nYour INTP will arrive in listening mode. Activate by reading one of the discussion prompts from the included 'How and Why' guide.\nAllow your INTP to wake up naturally after 18 years of simmering in isolation and a 12 hour sleep cycle. Make sure your INTP is covered in it's security blanket.\nGet your INTP out from under its blanket by reminding it of it's obligation to acknowledge you.\nIf step 3 didn't work, ask about one of the photographs in the included box.\n\nModes:\nSocial mode: You have invited your INTP to a party. Where did they go? They went outside to have a quiet chat with one of the other introverts. Don\u2019t worry! They aren\u2019t feeling left out. And they\u2019re going to leave soon anyways. They are exhausted after having to fake-laugh at SEVERAL bad jokes on their way through the house.\nFriend mode: You\u2019ve known your INTP for several months now. They have just now decided you are friends. In exchange for consistency and honestly, your INTP can entertain you with insightful jokes and interesting theories. Be sure to regularly stimulate your INTP with a hypothetical question, but don\u2019t overwhelm them with too many obligations. Another plus: your INTP will never be mad if you cancel plans and they\u2019re probably ok with winging it last second.\nGhost mode: Your INTP has just witnessed an Unreasonable Action\u2122 by a third party. This may have been insisting on something like the flatness of the earth, or something that lacks total self awareness like extreme self-absorbtion. That third party will never be taken seriously again. Your INTP unit will not re-evaluate the situation. You may discount the possibility of EVER re-introducing your INTP to this person.\nProject Mode: Something has piqued your INTP\u2019s curiosity! They have spent all of yesterday on their computer researching. Now they are coming home with an armful of supplies and a glimmer in their eye! This is the First Project They Are Actually Going To Complete At Long Last Maybe.\nProject Mode (addendum): Your INTP has covered their desk/living room/bedroom with items pertaining to their newest hobby. They are now scrolling absentmindedly through instagram with a family size Dorito bag. What happened? They have already glimpsed the theoretical result! How satisfying! Much more satisfying than putting in the work to finish it. Maybe they\u2019ll at least clean up the living room later.\nI-Told-You-So Mode: The INTP gave you advice a few months ago. You didn\u2019t follow the advice they gave you. Now you are complaining to the INTP about the predicted results. Your INTP is digging deep to provide you with sympathy, but they also want to be recognized as having-been-right-this-whole-time-thank-you-very-much.\nTroubleshooting:\nWhy isn\u2019t my INTP doing anything? What does it want?\nYour INTP doesn\u2019t know what it wants. In some ways your INTP is afraid to want things because what if what it wants won\u2019t make it happy? What if  it fails at getting what it wants? What if it doesn\u2019t finish? Your INTP has implicitly decided that things are Fine Just Like This. Best not to rock the boat, eh? If you\u2019d like to motivate your INTP, reassure them that they are capable and that the only way forward is to make a choice.\nWhy does my INTP keep dropping their items/hurting themselves?\nYour INTP has an Se Trickster function which means it lacks awareness of the physical environment. Included in the accessories are a first aide kit and some paper towels.\nWhy didn\u2019t my INTP notice/remember ______ about me?\nYour INTP has an Se Trickster function which means it lacks awareness of other people\u2019s experiences. It is best to just remind the INTP unit of these facts\u2014 they mean no harm in forgetting.\nMy INTP seemed upset. Should I ask what\u2019s wrong and what they\u2019re feeling?\nNO. Your INTP does not know what it\u2019s feeling. It may become flustered or misattribute the cause of its discomfort if pressed for an answer. In this scenario, bring your INTP unit the blanket from its accessory package and make it clear that you will be there when they want you. Your INTP greatly appreciates you, we promise.\n\u200b\nFinal Notes:\nIn time (lots of time) your INTP will come to love you. And contrary to popular believe advanced-model INTPs know exactly how to show you their appreciation. They can be great gift-givers and patient conversationalists. They can accept reasonable criticisms and be good problem solvers. They're good at asking questions and absolutely want you to have a full understanding what they're saying (by simplifying something that is complex to it's essentials) and not overwhelm you with needless rhetoric. They can even use their introspection to better understand YOU!\n\n"}, {"title": "My mom and sister were having a deep discussion...

It makes sense, doesn't it?  People like you represent a fraction of the total population, so it can be hard to relate to others sometimes. In a world of extroverts and judges, introverted dreamers can feel left out by society. Not that it bothers you too much of course.\n\u200b\nYou may also have noticed, my young INTP, that the job market and this economic system do not align with your values and goals, for after all, isn't a modern job just a form of voluntary, paid slavery?  It's okay to be who you are, and most of your anxieties about life are most likely valid. But I want you to know something else, because I know you're not being taught this at school. I want you to know that the world is your playground, provided you don't spoil it for others. Be kind, and be trustful, but be aware. Danger lies beneath the sand.\n\u200b\nTravel. But first, reboot your system. And try to be healthy, because there is nothing more pitiful than an unhealthy INTP, specially abroad.\n\u200b\nMental health has a lot to do with habits. Be healthy and start by eating properly, exercising. Then get in the habit of cleaning your room. Or save time by getting in the habit of keeping your room clean in the first place. The trick is having multiple trash cans and laundry bins in the right places. And don't eat in your room, it's the easiest way to start a bad habit.\n\u200b\nWith a healthy core and a healthy heart, travel. You think in terms of systems and patterns and theories and designs, so even though you think you have it all mapped out in your head, go out and shatter your own reality, go and smash it into the ground, and travel where your heart desires. Get lost in the world. As you experience your newfound ability to adapt and to thrive, free from the mental, social, and economic shackles imposed by others and adopted by you in your former place of existence, your change of perspective feeds fresh new information to your intuitive center, and therein lies the mechanism tasked with your mental innovation.\n\u200b\nAnd you ought to innovate. You ought to innovate because you control destinies. So know that you are not condemned to merely survive your existence. An INTP needs purpose, even when the nihilist side prevails.  And you'll need friends for the journey, friends you can elevate and friends who can elevate you. Get yourself a book on body language, it's impossible not to pick up on physical cues when you're so adept at noticing patterns. Then acquire some leadership skills.\n\u200b\nLearn to listen. Learn to talk. Learn to think. Learn to feel. Learn to live.\n\u200b\nHealthy INTPs make for excellent leaders, though most prefer to be led by a leader they themselves believe in.  In your travels, you will realize that there are many ways to navigate life. Your preconceived notions will be destroyed, and when that happens, ask yourself whether you should be learning new things and expanding your mind, or unlearning everything and clearing your mind.\n\u200b\nYour special capacity for thinking is a torment in and of itself. Tame it through meditation, and realize that nothing matters beyond that which minimizes suffering. And even then, it doesn't matter, which is why you are tasked with making your own purpose and meaning along the way. And though you may be wrong or you may walk along the wrong path, know that this is okay and a good thing in the grand scheme of things. The world will make you feel inferior for your failures, even when you dutifully set out knowing that you would fail in the first place, because you wanted to experience something. Do not falter when the naysayers get loud, it's a distraction, but do understand and anticipate the consequences of whatever you set out to do.\nAnd do not make the mistake of boxing yourself into your type. You are not your type, you are a being with particular preferences and desires and motivations, dreams and goals. Become a chameleon. Challenge perception. Set out to reinvent yourself. Evolve.\n\u200b\nBecause the world is your playground, and you deserve to be happy.\n\n"}, {"title": "Just a question, how are you all still alive?

(don't complicate yourself. the only exercises you need are: deadlift, squats, chin ups, overhead press, bent-Over Rows, and push ups, in that order. you dont need any protein, no products, just your garden or room, a bar and some water drums. this doesnt have to take you more than 3 hours a week if you dont want to.\n\u200b\nthird: sleep well. some hacks: if you dont eat any carbohydrate 4 hours before going to sleep, you will do it better. reduce light since sunset if you can, and avoid over stimuli. what about an audiobook while lying? remember than if you wake up at 6 to 8 am and see daylight (not directly to the sun please), your circadian rhythm will accommodate a little more.\n\u200b\nfourth: the only rule you need. just make it simple. forget all those endless books about self help. i dont know you but i get lost a lot trying to remember their advices and i end up anxious. the only mental thing you have to do is to learn the \"habit of get things done\". as simple as setting a reasonable daily goal, and do it. no matter what.\n\u200b\nfifth: if you fail at this point, you fuck everything: overcome your addictions. and im not talking about heroin or cocain. im talking about serious shit here. the most fucked up addictions for your mind and dopaminergic system are excessive sugar, caffeine, pornography, videogames, alcohol, tobacco, tv series, internet. They are so addictive that people look for excuses or try to put reasoning about their use. and dont try to figure out how much is too much. you will know it when you start feeling like shit. as simple as that.\n\u200b\nsixth: a human being need a goal and to work for it. there is no happiness in the perfect life. unlike the freudian philosophy says, tension in life is necessary.\n\u200b\nI've committed all the mistakes named above. even worse, i find it difficult to follow the right path. but now i feel better with my life even when i lose my way. my worst enemy is my procrastination.

(self.INTP)", "likes": "167", "comments": "75", "content": "It seems like at least once every week someone on this subreddit makes a post about Asperger's wherein he or she attempts to draw a correlation between the INTP personality type and what happens to be a very trendy disorder at the moment. This serves to affirm my suspicion that many -- if not most -- people who browse /r/intp don't understand or outright disregard the function stack. \nEach personality type is defined by the expression of four main functions. For INTP, these are:\n\nIntroverted Thinking \nExtroverted iNtuition\nIntroverted Sensing\nExtroverted Feeling\n\nPeople with Asperger's are usually characterized as aloof, eccentric, excessively rational loners, which fits with our primary function and, admittedly, with some INTPs stereotypes. The problem with this diagnosis, however, is our secondary function: Extroverted iNtuition rapidly absorbs and interprets external data, recognizing patterns and forming impressions of situations or problems as a whole. This is crucial to the INTP typing, because it's what gives us the big-picture perspective that differentiates us from other Ti users, as well as our designation as social chameleons. The Asperger's diagnosis, by contrast, is based largely on a lack of these exact qualities. \nLet's consider some common indicators of Asperger's syndrome:\n\nDifficulties with high-level language skills such as verbal reasoning, problem solving, making inferences and predictions\n\nThis reads more like a list of our strengths than deficiencies. INTPs excel at critical thinking, hence our tendency to score high on IQ tests, which emphasize this primarily.\n\nDifficulties in empathizing with others\n\nINTPs may have difficulty expressing empathy, because Fe is our inferior function and, as such, is usually the last to be developed. That said, most of us have no difficulty assuming somebody else's perspective and imagining what his thoughts and feelings might be. Even when an INTP plays Devil's Advocate -- which we're notorious for doing -- we're not being insincere: we actually become someone, if only temporarily, who believes in that position. A person with Asperger's most likely would not be able to do this.\n\nProblems with understanding another person\u2019s point of view\n\nSee above.\n\nDifficulties engaging in social routines such as conversations and \u2018small talk\u2019\n\nINTPs may not enjoy small talk -- it may seem boring or superfluous -- but we're at least able to understand its role in society, and given that most of us have a broad range of interests, it's rarely difficult to find something to talk about. Like all introverts, we may be shy, because we don't have as much impetus as extroverts to get over fear of social interaction, but Asperger's is not about being shy.\n\nProblems with controlling feelings such as anger, depression and anxiety\n\nAny time your Feeling function falls into the inferior position, it's going to take some effort to learn how to express it appropriately, but most of us seem to err on the side of excessively restricting our emotions, rather than acting out.\n\nA preference for routines and schedules which can result in stress or anxiety if a routine is disrupted\n\nIn my experience, and based on what I've read from others in this subreddit, we tend to have the opposite problem: forming routines is difficult for us and treated as a necessary evil at best, in most cases.\n\nSpecialized fields of interest or hobbies \n\nINTPs tend to burn through hobbies and interests, learning enough to feel competent, but rarely mastering anything. Once we've solved the main problems, we get bored and move on. One of our members, /u/Sherlocked_, created a subscription service called New Hobby Box that sends supplies to experiment with a new hobby every month. That's INTPs for you.\nFrankly, I don't know how someone with Asperger's could possibly type as INTP, given that they would not exhibit the qualities for Ne to appear as a secondary function -- which is not to say it can't happen, but I certainly don't see a greater risk among INTPs than other types. However, if you honestly feel you might have Asperger's syndrome, please seek an evaluation from a professional: while I think the stigma surrounding disorders like this is unwarranted -- being different doesn't necessarily mean there's something \"wrong\" with you -- it can be seriously limiting if left untreated. In the meantime, over- and self-diagnosing trivializes the disorder for people who are actually suffering and makes it more difficult for them to get the help they need, so could we go ahead and knock it off? Thanks.\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, anonymous redditor!\nEdit 2: I feel I need to clarify that my original post specifically concerns people who diagnose themselves with Asperger's or who claim that INTPs are more likely to have Asperger's than other personality types. I'm not claiming that INTP Aspies don't exist, nor am I doubting anyone here who claims to have Asperger's, as long as he or she has been professionally diagnosed. To reiterate: while INTPs may have Asperger's, the personality type itself does not resemble Asperger's, and please don't diagnose yourself with a condition people legitimately suffer from based on a few articles you've read online. \n\n"}, {"title": "The most INTP College Application Ever (self.INTP)", "likes": "52", "comments": "10", "content": "My little brother's college app:\nThe Prompt: Describe your academic and career plans and any special interests (for example, scientific research) that you are eager to pursue as an undergraduate\nHis answer: \"I have a strong desire to pursue a degree in both mathematics and philosophy because both enforce an understanding of ideas that have depth and logic. \nThe desire that I have is to explore and develop ideas fully.\nAlong with this, I am looking for the peace of mind that comes with being able to think about the world in a rigorous way.

I want to learn to think with depth and learn to be comfortable with not knowing the solution to a problem, but rather enjoy the process of solving. \nI think that learning this attitude is incredibly important for me, because if one can have happiness and peace of mind in solving difficult, abstract problems instead of being so previously concerned, and ultimately neurotic about getting the solution, I think that this can lead to a higher quality of life, and a fusion of the purely rational way of thinking and the faith and intuition that is so necessary to being able to stick with a process over the longer haul. The solution to the problems I will develop will be purely rational, but the process won\u2019t be due to the amount of initial guesswork I\u2019ll have to do.

Even still though, I've noticed a huge trend of confusion that I think needs thoroughly addressed here and that is the difference between INTPs and INTJs. \nIf we were talking about say INTPs vs ISTPs, or INTPs vs INFPs, I would probably shy away from the discussion of those topics as I'm not confident in my familiarity with those other types. However, I know INTJs like the back of my hand as my father is an ideal portrait of a healthy INTJ. Having known an INTJ my whole life, I can say that there is an enormous difference in the way we process the world. It's ironic that INTPs and INTJs can have not a single cognitive function in common, yet appear so similar from afar. Hopefully, this in-depth analysis will help shed some light on the matter though, and can give you a distinction between the two types better than the watered down versions many find on the various MBTI sites. Let's get started.\nFirst order of business here is to break down these two personality types into their primary cognitive functions.\nINTP\nDominant - Ti\nAuxiliary - Ne\nTertiary - Si\nInferior - Fe\nINTJ\nDominant - Ni\nAuxiliary - Te\nTertiary - Fi\nInferior - Se\nThis list will be here for reference as we contrast the two types' cognitive functions, one by one. Use it to help piece together the overall personalities once you've read over the more meticulous differences between the two. We will begin with the intuitive functions.\nNi vs Ne\nTo give you an idea of the differences between these two functions, I'll give examples of how my intuition works in my life (Ne) and how my father's works in his (Ni).\nNe for myself works as so: An INTP generally goes through life forming all kinds of different theories on a multitude of topics. For myself, I generally think very hard with my Ti to bring about an understanding of all kinds of complex systems. However, there are times when my Ti is at work piecing the puzzles together when all of the sudden, it's like my mind was just struck with lightning. Without any sort of effort, my head just snaps all of those pieces into place and I instantly have a complete understanding of that complex system I was trying to grasp. It's what many call an epiphany. These aren't exclusive to types with Ne high on their list, but it definitely happens much more often to those types. \nAnother trait that goes along with Ne's is that they are huge idea generators. I'm talking creative powerhouses. Ne's are always jumping from one idea to the next. The way this manifests itself in my life is that I am always coming up with new things to do with myself. This happens so much that my follow through with my ideas can sometimes be very lacking. By the time I have gotten into one of my ideas, I have already gotten bored with it and am focusing on something else. For example, I decided it would be good for me to read romance novels to help improve my weak feeling functions. I went to the bookstore, got 2 books of that genre, and after a few pages into one of them, I haven't touched either of them in weeks. This is because I decided I should be spending my free time working on my golf game instead. This will probably also be something I'll end up bored with, as well. But the point is that we are really good at coming up with new ideas. This jumping between ideas is what gives INTPs their objectivity in thought too, because they can see things from so many different perspectives. There are many other traits to this function, but these are some big ones.\nMy father's Ni: Although I'm not sure what the experience of perceiving through Ni is like, I can give a very good example of how Ni looks from third person. My dad, just like me, can come up with ideas well, too. The difference is that his ideas are more quality over quantity. They aren't something he jumps ship on quickly, either. He literally obsesses over the visions he has for himself and the world around him. For example, he is the CEO of a mortgage company worth somewhere around $50 million right now. He has very specific ideas for how to run his business and rides his employees to do it exactly how he wants. Not only that, but he works way outside the 9 to 5 shift. He is restless with his visions for his company. If something important is going on in his business that can probably wait until the next business day to continue, he will stay in his office and work till 10 or 11 at night and won't look away from what he's doing. Hunger and sleep are his lowest priorities in this mode. It is focus beyond what I can describe, all fueled by his desire to live out his strong visions.\nSo the major difference? Ne's tend to jump between different ideas a lot, while Ni's narrow down on one idea until completion. Next, thinking functions.\nTi vs Te\nTi's are HUGE thinkers. We don't stop. And since introverted thinking is an INTPs main function, this tends to manifest itself in our very sedentary lifestyle. Basically, if you find yourself constantly sitting on your bed just mulling ideas over in your head, there's a good chance that you are an INTP. We enjoy very lofty thinking that doesn't even necessarily help us in real life. For example, I can spend hours trying to really understand how abstraction can exist in our minds. Or even thoughts in general. I have trouble understanding how simple matter and energy can create such an experience, and thinking about it for a long time won't get me any closer to the real answer. But for some reason, it's incredibly stimulating to my mind. I can come up with my own personal theories about these topics and keep looking through different lenses (with my Ne) to see what fits best. Ti's also tend to overthink a lot of the basic parts of life because they are used to such heavy lifting with their rational-faculties. Things like simple social interaction can be difficult for them as they will second guess everything they say.\nTe's are much different. They are very progressive in their thoughts. They don't analyze a topic until they are blue in the face. They will look at that topic, see the major points, come to a conclusion, and move on. Simple as that. The only problem with this is that they can sometimes overlook vital information, and since they are so quick to reach an answer, they can often make wrong conclusions and have trouble understanding why they were wrong.\nI will give an example of Ti vs Te. My dad and I once got in a debate over religion. I am an atheist while he is an agnostic, but was defending religion in society. For every argument he posed, I began breaking it down and explaining why that argument isn't a very valid one. Before I can finish the one I'm on, he interrupts me and brings up another big point, as if it's a rebuttal to what I'm saying. I break that down for him as to why that's wrong. He interrupts again. Before I know it, he's been able to simply explain all his overgeneralized points while never letting me take the time analyze them for him and fully explain them. This is very progressive, yet very glossy. It just sounds like good points with very little analysis behind them. \nI got very frustrated the whole time because he was oversimplifying everything and this is the big difference between Ti's and Te's. Te's focus on the main points but don't like to dig deep into them, while Ti's like to take their time and look at each one, making sure they are as they appear. Ti's are also much better at handling subjects that involve deeper thought like calculus or physics. Not that Te's can't do those things, too, but they are much better at simple thinking tasks, especially since they are quicker at thinking than Ti's.\nThese next two function types will be on the weaker side for both types so they will tend to be obscure facets to their personality that can sometimes become negatively used.\nSi vs Se\nSi is associated with having keen senses for the outside world. They pick details very well with all of their 5 senses. My brother is Si dominant and his hearing is incredible. Since Ne can suppress INTP's Si a lot though, our senses aren't fantastic. We tend to be in our own world. But when we can focus on the world around us, we have decent sensing skills. \nAnother aspect of Si is that it is directed a lot toward the past. Strong Si's have impeccable memory. My brother loves watching jeopardy because it's all about remembering random facts. He can get at least 60 percent of the answers right. It's honestly crazy to watch. For an INTP, memory tends to only be strong with their serious interests. This differs from strong Si's as they can remember things outside of their own interest with ease. This memory also helps with learning from the past. INTPs who can effectively use their Si can look to the past at times to help make decisions they are currently facing.\nFinally, Si's focus their senses more on themselves. They like relieving whatever physical discomforts they have. Things like hunger and sleep are immediate priorities for strong Si's (the opposite of the Ni I described for my dad earlier). So INTPs may have moments where they are particularly concerned with being comfortable. It's not always important to them though as Si isn't a strong function for them.\nAs for Se's, they are very similar except that their sensing doesn't focus much towards the past. They also aren't worried about physical comfort as much. Rather, they enjoy experiencing the outside world a lot and would enjoy things like sports and general exercise. For INTJs, this isn't a prominent feature (as it\u2019s their 4th function), but they may have a slight edge in athletic ability. My dad was apparently awesome at basketball when he was younger. He is 50 now and can still take me in a 1v1 (I'm an in shape 19 year old lol). \nAnyway, these are the slight differences in sensing functions between the two. Now for feeling.\nFi vs Fe\nBoth INTPs and INTJs aren't fantastic with emotions. However, their faults are quite different.\nFe is INTPs 4th function and therefore malfunctions quite a bit. Fe is involved in feeling and understanding the emotions of those around you. It is also involved in how well you can express your feelings. For INTPs, they tend to be very oblivious to others emotions, often making jokes or being sarcastic in ways that can hurt those around them. It normally isn\u2019t until after they say something that they realize where they\u2019ve gone wrong. It tends to be the misconception that INTPs don\u2019t care about others emotions, but they honestly do. It is more that they are so awful at expressing that concern for others emotions that they tend to avoid it all together, making them seen disinterested in them (especially when they let things slip out that they didn\u2019t realize would hurt others). \nAs for their own emotions, their rational brain tends to suppress the processing of any emotions they are having on the inside (which is Fi, their 8th function) and this makes the expression of those emotions practically non-existent. However, in the rare occasion where INTPs emotions have been so highly stimulated that it is brought into conscious awareness (which is incredibly rare because 8th functions almost never make appearences), they tend to feel very helpless as they aren\u2019t used to having to deal with emotions. A healthy INTP would know that they need to let these feelings escape, and turn to someone for help. Unfortunately though, many try to push their emotions away, which is like fighting gravity. Their emotions persist to grow as they are being ignored until they become so big that they drive an INTP to partake in reckless behavior, which is very outside their normal character. These are under extreme circumstances, however.\nA well-developed INTP would be someone who can empathize and relate their emotional experiences with others. They also wouldn\u2019t fear the expression of their emotions even though it might not come out so pretty.\nAs for INTJs, their emotional world is much different. INTJs are much more in-tune with their emotions than INTPs. They can see their changes in moods coming from a mile away, while INTPs cannot. If they are in a bout of emotional turmoil, they are much better at handling those emotions internally rather than expressing them to others. Because Fi is the function for processing one\u2019s emotions on a deep level, this tends to help drive their Ni and turn their dreams into reality.\nWith Fi\u2019s, they can have moments of selfishness or excessive, belligerent behavior to defend their emotions. During some dark times in my family, my dad used to have a huge drinking problem and would become somewhat violent when he was drunk. This is an example of higher Fi, as Fe is deep in their unconscious. They can be very un-empathetic because they are more concerned with their own emotions. If caring for your emotions greatly impedes on their own emotional state, they will not try to do so.\nHowever, if they are not within the emotional context of a situation, INTJs can be great people to turn to. Because Fi is much stronger than Fe, as long you are important to them and you are in a serious life crisis, they can have an empathy towards your situation that can go intensely deeper than an INTPs. They may have trouble expressing it to you, but you can see it in their eyes and general demeanor that your situation is impacting them, too. I turn to my dad whenever I am in a scary place in my life, and he is a great person to talk to in order to work things out.\nSo the difference between the two types, INTPs are horrible with understanding their emotions and even when they do, they have trouble expressing them. They have trouble picking up on others emotions, too, but when they do, they can become connected with those people easily. INTJs DO understand their emotions, but don\u2019t feel the need to express them, nor do they worry too much about others. Only in certain circumstances do they feel the need to sooth others emotions.\nI read someone say this somewhere in this sub that described it well. \u201cINTJs are the coldest human-beings; INTPs are the warmest machines.\u201d\nAnyway, that\u2019s it for the functions. Sometimes looking at people\u2019s face personalities can make them confusing, but if you break them down into parts it\u2019s easier to see what you are. If you need anymore assistance distinguishing between the two, just comment and I\u2019ll try to clear things up more.\nIf you still aren\u2019t sure what you are, here\u2019s a good way to tell: If you tested INTP, but then found ways to relate to other personalities and are constantly re-evaluating whether you\u2019re really an INTP, then you probably are one. If you accepted that you\u2019re an INTP or INTJ right away without trying to analyze it too much, then chances are that you\u2019re an INTJ. Kind of ironic.\nBut thanks for reading, peace.\n\n"}]]}
